"I am trying to send a string via http/post in Racket, this is what I tried so far after reading the Racket HTTP Client Documentation
#lang racket

(define
  myUrl ""https://something.com"")

   (http-conn-open
    myUrl
    #:ssl? #t)
   #:version ""1.1""
   #:method ""POST""
   #:data ""Hello"")

But with this I receive the following error:
tcp-connect: connection failed
  detail: host not found
  address: https://www.w3.org/
  port number: 443
  step: 1
  system error: nodename nor servname provided, or not known; errno=8

I tried it with several different adresses.
I am new to racket and programming in general and unable to figure out what I am missing.
","In your example, the hostname is only the www.w3.org portion -- not including the scheme (http or https) nor any path. So for example this does work:
(http-conn-open ""www.w3.com""
                #:ssl? #t)

To make a post request, you could do this:
#lang racket

(require net/http-client)

(define-values (status headers in)
  (http-sendrecv ""www.w3.com""
                 ""/""
                 #:ssl? #t
                 #:version ""1.1""
                 #:method ""POST""
                 #:data ""Hello""))
(displayln status)
(displayln headers)
(displayln (port->string in))
(close-input-port in)

In Racket, a function can return multiple values. http-sendrecv returns three, and the define-values assigns each one to a variable.
net/http-client provides other functions to let you make a connection to a host, make multiple requests on that connection, then close the connection.

"Is it possible to expand a macro at run time in a compiled lisp executable? I would expect it to be impossible as macro expansion can only happen pre-compilation yet when i call macroexpand in compiled code i get output.
","A macro is a function that's normally called automatically during compilation or evaluation, and whose return value is then compiled or evaluated in place of the original expression.
But since it's just a function, there's nothing preventing it from being called explicitly during run time as well, and that's what MACROEXPAND and MACROEXPAND-1 do.
It's roughly equivalent to:
(defun macroexpand-1 (form &optional env)
  (if (and (listp form) (car form)) ;; list expression
      (let ((macfun (macro-function (car form)))
        (if macfun

      form))

(Note that this definition doesn't handle symbol macros or use *MACROEXPAND-HOOK*, to keep it simple.)
It's possible to use EVAL-WHEN when defining the macro to make the macro definition only available in the compilation environment. If you do that, trying to expand at run time will fail.
",,"In Common Lisp and other Lisps that support macro systems like Emacs Lisp, macros are expanded at compile-time by default. However, you can use runtime evaluation of forms to achieve similar effects, even though the macros themselves won't be re-expanded at runtime in a typical compiled executable. When `macroexpand` is called during runtime, it simply expands the form into its corresponding code without re-evaluating it. This is why you see output from `macroexpand` in compiled code—it's just showing you what the macro would expand to, not actually executing any further expansion or evaluation of the expanded form.",0.5303,[[0.37910799]],0.09386707911225581,0.23774923843810583,0.3821138211382114,0.05737704918032787,0.15447154471544716
"I am trying to create a command that will indent a selected region by 4 spaces.

Thanks!
","If you look at the documentation for indent-rigidly (C-h f indent-rigidly), you'll notice that it takes 3-4 arguments:
(indent-rigidly START END ARG &optional INTERACTIVE)

So, you should supply the start and end positions to it as well. You should also just give the ARG normally, instead of using universal-argument.

",,"The issue with your function definition lies in how you are using `universal-argument`. The `universal-argument` command is meant to be interactive and typically used within a different context, such as when called directly by the user or through keybindings. When you use it interactively within a function like this, it expects additional input from the user, hence the error 'Wrong number of arguments: (0 . 0), 1'. 

To achieve the desired functionality of indenting a selected region by 4 spaces, you can directly call `indent-rigidly` with the appropriate arguments. Here is how you can modify your function:

```lisp

"More specifically, I need any instance of | to be transformed into \|. I tried reading the documentation on reader macros and I am extremely lost. Can somebody explain this in understandable terms, or ideally show me how to write such a macro. 
","You're essentially destroying the usual meaning of | in the usual syntax, so you should really do that in some uniform way to minimize surprises.  Your solution doesn't do that -- it treats | differently based on whether it's the first thing or not, and that's bad.  For example, xxx|xxx reads it as a character in the whole symbol which means that you get a symbol with a name of ""xxx|xxx"", but with an input of |xxx you get two symbols, with names of ""|"" and ""xxx"" respectively.  It's therefore better to just make your syntax treat | as other characters to get a more consistent and easier-to-explain behavior.
Another possible problem with your code is your use of #f as a readtable, which means that the reader is not going to compose with a reader that is potentially modified.
And finally, you should really pay attention to the extra arguments and return a syntax object when they're given.  The reason for that is obvious, and my guess is that your reason for not doing so is that you're interested in just reading such code.  But you should really have one eye looking at potential extensions, and in Racket, and obvious future for such code would be to make up a proper language instead of a read+eval hack.  It's true that it might seem like an overkill, but in this case there is a simple solution of using the ""same as this other character"" shortcut to avoid writing lengthy code.
The following addresses all of these:
(define rt (let ([c (current-readtable)]) (make-readtable c #\| #\a c)))

",,"Certainly! In Lisp, you can define reader macros to transform certain characters into other forms during the read phase of evaluation. The `#.` notation is used for reader macros, and they are defined using the `set-macro-character` function.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to replace all instances of `|` with `\|`:

1. Define a function that will handle the transformation.
2. Use `set-macro-character` to associate this function with the `|` character.

Below is an example implementation in Common Lisp:

```lisp
(defun transform-bar (stream char)

"I'm trying to write a function that adds an element to each element of a given powerset. No matter what it always evaluates (null pset) as true. I can't understand why. 
Here's what I have so far:
(defun addxtopowerset(x pset)
     (cond
        ((null pset) (list x '())) ; If the powerset is null, display x and NIL.
        ;;First display a list combining x and the first item of pset. Then display the first item of pset itself. Then recursively call the function passing the rest of pset as a parameter.
        (T (list 'x (car pset))(list (car pset))
        (addxtopowersetch x (cdr pset))))) 

","First, note that in the terminal case you should return an empty list, since is in the recursion that all the elements of the powerset are processed, and we should assume that a powerset is always a list of list, each of them representing a set (in fact, the powerset of an empty set contains at least one element, the empty set itself).
So, since a powerset is a non-empty list, the task of adding a new element to the powerset can be solved by adding to the result, for each list of the powerset, both the list and a copy of the list with the element added.
In both cases, “add” means: get something and return a new-something, and use the value returned, otherwise, as Rainer Joswig note, “the result go straight into the digital nirvana”. In other words, in the recursive case your function must add the two values, the list and the new list with the element added, to the result of the recursive call. So, here is the function:
(defun addxtopowerset(x pset)
   (if (null pset)
       nil
       (append (list (car pset) (cons x (car pset))) 
               (addxtopowerset x (cdr pset)))))

Finally, here a couple of alternative ways of defining the function, the first one with the high order function mapcan:
(defun addxtopowerset(x pset)
  (mapcan (lambda(y) (list y (cons x y))) pset))

and the second one with a loop:
(defun addxtopowerset(x pset)
  (loop for y in pset append (list y (cons x y))))

",,"The issue with your function lies in the parentheses and logic flow. Specifically, you are not properly structuring the list that is returned by each recursive call.

Here's how you can correct your function:\n\n```lisp\n(defun addxtopowerset (x pset)\n  (cond\n    ((null pset) (list (list x))) ; Return a list containing (x nil) if the powerset is null.\n    (T (cons (list x (car pset)) ; First, prepend a new subset with `x` and the first element of `pset`\n             (addxtopowerset x (cdr pset)))))) ; Then, recursively process the rest of the powerset\n)\n```\nThis function will correctly add `x` to each element of the given powerset.

The respectable way:
(loop

   collect x

for <var> on <list> iterates over all sublists, meaning var will be bound to (a b c), then (b c) then (c) and finally ().
(x . xs) is a destructuring notation to bind respectively x and xs to the head and tail of each list being visited. This is necessary here to check whether there are remaining elements.
collect <val> adds <val> to implicit collection being built

"Could someone explain to me what's going on in this very simple code snippet?
(defun test-a ()
  (let ((x '(nil)))
    (setcar x (cons 1 (car x)))
    x))

Upon a calling (test-a) for the first time, I get the expected result: ((1)).
But to my surprise, calling it once more, I get ((1 1)), ((1 1 1)) and so on.
Why is this happening? Am I wrong to expect (test-a) to always return ((1))?
Also note that after re-evaluating the definition of test-a, the return result resets.
Also consider that this function works as I expect:
(defun test-b ()
  (let ((x '(nil)))
    (setq x (cons (cons 1 (car x)) 
                  (cdr x)))))

(test-b) always returns ((1)).
Why aren't test-a and test-b equivalent?
","The Bad
test-a is self-modifying code. This is extremely dangerous. While the variable x disappears at the end of the let form, its initial value persists in the function object, and that is the value you are modifying. Remember that in Lisp a function is a first class object, which can be passed around (just like a number or a list), and, sometimes, modified. This is exactly what you are doing here: the initial value for x is a part of the function object and you are modifying it.
Let us actually see what is happening:
(symbol-function 'test-a)
=> (lambda nil (let ((x (quote (nil)))) (setcar x (cons 1 (car x))) x))
(test-a)
=> ((1))
(symbol-function 'test-a)
=> (lambda nil (let ((x (quote ((1))))) (setcar x (cons 1 (car x))) x))
(test-a)
=> ((1 1))
(symbol-function 'test-a)
=> (lambda nil (let ((x (quote ((1 1))))) (setcar x (cons 1 (car x))) x))
(test-a)
=> ((1 1 1))
(symbol-function 'test-a)
=> (lambda nil (let ((x (quote ((1 1 1))))) (setcar x (cons 1 (car x))) x))

The Good
test-b returns a fresh cons cell and thus is safe. The initial value of x is never modified. The difference between (setcar x ...) and (setq x ...) is that the former modifies the object already stored in the variable x while the latter stores a new object in x. The difference is similar to x.setField(42) vs. x = new MyObject(42) in C++.
The Bottom Line
In general, it is best to treat quoted data like '(1) as constants - do not modify them:

quote returns the argument, without evaluating it.  (quote x) yields x.
  Warning: quote does not construct its return value, but just returns
  the value that was pre-constructed by the Lisp reader (see info node
  Printed Representation). This means that (a . b) is not
  identical to (cons 'a 'b): the former does not cons.  Quoting should
  be reserved for constants that will never be modified by side-effects,
  unless you like self-modifying code. See the common pitfall in info
  node Rearrangement for an example of unexpected results when
  a quoted object is modified.

If you need to modify a list, create it with list or cons or copy-list instead of quote.
See more examples.
PS. This has been duplicated on Emacs.
PPS. See also Why does this function return a different value every time? for an identical Common Lisp issue.
",,"The behavior you're observing is due to how `setcar` works in Lisp. In your `test-a` function, `(x)` is a list containing one element, which is the symbol `nil`. When you use `(setcar x (cons 1 (car x)))`, you are modifying the car of `x` by setting it to a new cons cell that contains `1` and whatever was previously at the head of `x`.

Since `x` is a list with one element (`nil`), after the first call, `(car x)` becomes `nil`, so `(cons 1 (car x))` creates a new cons cell `(1 . nil)`. However, since `setcar` modifies the same list in place, and `x` still points to that same list, every subsequent call continues to append another `1` at the beginning of the existing list.

This is why you see the result growing: each call appends an additional `1`.

In contrast, your `test-b` function uses `setq` to assign a new value to `x`. This creates a fresh cons cell for every evaluation and does not modify the original list. Therefore, `test-b` always returns `((1))`, as expected.

To make `test-a` behave like `test-b`, you could use `setf` with `car` to create a new list on each call:

```lisp
(defun test-c ()
  (let ((x '(nil)))
    (setf x (cons 1 (car x)))
    x))
```

This way, `test-c` will also return `((1))` every time it is called.",0.6038,[[0.61841805]],0.1743117939469967,0.24756060042122227,0.4639498432601882,0.14465408805031446,0.21316614420062696
"In a let form (Clojure here) I can doing something like
(let [[u s v] (svd A)] 
   (do-something-with u v))

where svd returns a list of length three. This is a very natural sort of thing to do, so why isn't that we don't we have
(def [u s v] (svd A))

and its various generalizations as the default behavior of the def form? I don't see how this would interfere with anything that def is already doing. Can someone who understands the Zen of Lisp or Clojure explain why def does not support binding (with destructuring) as powerful as let?
","def is a special form at the compiler level: it makes a Var. def has to be available and usable before destructuring is available. You see something similar with let*, a compiler primitive that supports no destructuring: then after several thousand lines in clojure/core.clj the language is finally powerful enough to provide a version of let with destructuring, as a macro on top of let*. 
If you want, you can write a macro (say, def+) that does this for you. Personally I think it's kinda gross and wouldn't use it, but using a Lisp means getting to use a language that suits you personally.
",,"In Clojure and more broadly in Lisp, `let` and `def` serve different purposes. The primary role of `let` is to create a lexical scope for bindings that are local to the body of the `let`. On the other hand, `def` is used to define global symbols with values that can be referenced outside their defining forms. While it might seem natural to extend `def` to support destructuring similar to `let`, there are several reasons why this hasn't been implemented as default behavior for `def`:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: `let` and `def` serve distinct roles in the language. `let` is about creating a local context, while `def` is about defining values that can be used globally.

2. **Clarity and Readability**: By keeping `def` simple and focused on global definitions, it maintains clarity for readers of the code. If `def` were to support destructuring by default, it could introduce unnecessary complexity in a form that is meant for simplicity.

3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Introducing such changes would require careful consideration to ensure backwards compatibility with existing codebases. Extending `def` might break assumptions and patterns established over the years.

4. **Specialization vs. Generalization**: `let` is specifically designed for local bindings, which often include destructuring because of its limited scope. On the other hand, global definitions via `def` are meant to be more general and should not be burdened with all the features that might make sense in a local context.

5. **Language Philosophy**: Lisp languages emphasize simplicity and explicitness. Adding complex behaviors to built-in forms can sometimes lead to overly powerful abstractions that might be misused or overcomplicated.

If you find yourself needing such behavior frequently, you could define your own macro to achieve the desired destructuring within `def`. For example:

```clojure
(defmacro def-svd [varname matrix & body]
  `(let [[~'u ~'s ~'v] (svd ~matrix)]
     (def ~(symbol varname) [u s v])
     ~@body))

;; Usage:
(def-svd svd-vals A 
  (do-something-with u v))
```

This approach allows you to maintain the simplicity of `def` while adding destructuring capabilities when needed.",0.5223,[[0.47405475]],0.05745932521214737,0.3297076818490822,0.2792792792792793,0.027149321266968326,0.13063063063063063
"I've been attempting to write a Lisp macro that would perfom the equivalent of ++ in other programming languages for semantic reasons.  I've attempted to do this in several different ways, but none of them seem to work, and all are accepted by the interpreter, so I don't know if I have the correct syntax or not.  My idea of how this would be defined would be

  (incf variable))

but this gives me a SIMPLE-TYPE-ERROR when trying to use it.  What would make it work?
","Remember that a macro returns an expression to be evaluated. In order to do this, you have to backquote:

",,"In Common Lisp, the `++` macro you're trying to define is not directly equivalent to a pre-increment operation like in C or other languages.

  `(incf ',variable))

This macro uses backquote and comma to correctly refer to the symbol `variable` rather than its evaluated form.

"I understand how quotes are represented in language:
(equal ''(1 2) (list 'quote (list 1 2))) ;; => T

but what about quasi-quotes? is it something like:
(equal ``(1 2) (list '<???> (list 1 2)))

Both quasiquote and backquote instead of <???> don't work.
","There is no standard representation in Common Lisp.  What backquote should do is specified, but there is no equivalent to quote.  In particular the spec says in 2.4.6, after giving the specification of how backquote should behave:

An implementation is free to interpret a backquoted form F1 as any form F2 that, when evaluated, will produce a result that is the same under equal as the result implied by the above definition, provided that the side-effect behavior of the substitute form F2 is also consistent with the description given above.

Note that this is not in fact a problem since backquote is a thing you can implement yourself, while quote needs to be in the guts of the language.
",,"In Lisp, `quasiquote` is a special form used for constructing lists with macros. The syntax uses `` ` `` (backquote) and `,` (unquote), not `<???>`. To illustrate, the expression `(1 2)` can be constructed using quasiquote like this:

``(list `(\,1 \,2))``

The `\,1` and `\,2` are unquote forms that insert the values of the variables directly into the list. Here’s an example to clarify:

```lisp
(let ((a 1) (b 2))
  `(list ,a ,b)) ;; => (list 1 2)
```

The expression `` `(`list ,a ,b)` ` inserts the values of `a` and `b` into the list. If you want to include a literal quote, you can use a backquote followed by a comma and then another backquote:

```lisp
`(quote (1 2)) ;; => '(1 2)
```

So, your initial attempt with `(list 'quote (list 1 2))` is not correct for using quasiquote. Instead, you would write something like this:

```lisp
(list `(\,quote (\,1 \,2))) ;; This constructs a list with elements 'quote and (1 2)

The question does not ask you to create a dotted pair, but how the dotted pair is printed. I suppose this question aims at showing you that lists are just dotted pairs printed in a special way.
If you write this in a REPL:
'(a b (c . e) (d . nil))

The REPL replies:
(A B (C . E) (D))

You have the exact same output if you write:
'(a . (b . ((c . e) . ((d . nil) . nil))))

Basically, (a b) is the list made of a symbol a in front of a sublist (b), written (a . (b)). Here I am only talking about how forms are read. If you write them directly in the REPL, they will first be read, then evaluated, and in that case you will get an error. That's why in the examples are quoted: an expression being quoted is not evaluated, but returned as-is.
If you want to write code that, when evaluated, produces the cons-cell (0 . 1), you have to write this list:
(cons 0 1)

The above is a list of three elements, which could be written equally:
(cons . (0 . (1 . nil)))

Your interpreter will read this list (a symbol, two numbers) and evaluate the resulting form. That forms produces, at runtime, the following cons cell:
(0 . 1)

",,"In Lisp, you can use the `cons` function along with quoting to create dotted pairs. However, for creating `(d . nil)`, you don't need to use `nil`; instead, you can directly quote it. The simplest expression that Lisp will print out when typing the given expression is: \n\n'(a b (c . e) (d . nil))\n\nThis is already a valid s-expression representing a list with a dotted pair.",0.6144,[[0.44353729]],0.041654531242056404,0.129751582327875,0.3010033444816053,0.1414141414141414,0.17391304347826086
"I am working on a homework assignment, and the first functions had me doing things like deleting a given element of a list, or displaying a given element of a list.  The next functions want me to delete nested lists, or display them.  Do you have any general tips for working with nested lists? I imagine the functions will be very similar to the ones I wrote before, just tweaked a bit. 
Here are two example of functions I have written so far. Note I must use the ""cond"" style of writing functions. 
(defun delnth(L A)
  (cond ((= A 1) (rest L))
        (t (cons (first L) (delnth (rest L) (- A 1))))))


(defun remv(A L)
  (cond ((eq A (first L)) (remv A (rest L)))
        ((null L) nil)
        (t (cons (first L) (remv A (rest L) )))))

","Both of your functions work with nested cons. '(1 2 3) is (1 . (2 . (3 . ())) and (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 '()))). A nested list would be that you also have nested cons in the car of cons. eg. ((1 . ()) . ()) ; ==> ((1)). 
It's important to be able to see ((1) (2 3)) and understand that it is ((1 . ()) . ((2 . (3 . ())) . ())) so that if you want to access 3 it's obviously the path d,a,d,a and in the reverse you can construct the accessor cadadr. 
cons with cons in the car part are trees. When you make a function that walks the tree you need to walk both the car and the cdr in the event they are cons. Thus:
;; generic function to walk trees and reduce
;; by combiner every value accessed by term 
;; the default argument to combiner is tree-null
(defun accumulate-tree (tree term combiner null-value)
  (labels ((rec (tree)
             (cond ((null tree) null-value)
                   ((atom tree) (funcall term tree))
                   (t (funcall combiner (rec (car tree)) 
                                        (rec (cdr tree)))))))
    (rec tree)))

(defun sum-numbers (tree)
  (accumulate-tree tree
                   #'identity
                   #'+
                   0))

(defun count-numbers (tree)
  (accumulate-tree tree
                   (lambda (v) (if (numberp v) 1 0)) 
                   #'+
                   0))

(sum-numbers '((1) (2 3) (((4)) 5)))   ; ==> 15
(count-numbers '(a b 4 3 (e f 5) . 9)) ; ==> 4

The combiner doesn't need to reduce to an atom:
(defun reverse-tree (tree)
  (accumulate-tree tree
                   #'identity
                   (lambda (a d) (cons d a))
                   '()))
(reverse-tree '((1 2) (3 4))) 
; ==> ((nil (nil . 4) . 3) (nil . 2) . 1)

The process involves creating a boundary polygon that encompasses all the polylines within the block and then using that polygon to create a new uni-body block.

Use `command` with the `BOUNDARY` command in AutoLISP to create a boundary polygon around the polylines.\n3.

"In the reddit interview with Peter Norvig, he says  

“For various reasons the set of web
  libraries and protocols were slower to

and consequently lisp adoption among the web community went down, and people went after languages with richer library sets.  
Is there a reason for this slowness in the building up the web frameworks by the LISP community? 
","Mr. Norvig's remark seemed to me to be more historical than an assessment of the current situation. Perhaps in the mid to late 90s web related libraries didn't appear as quickly in Common Lisp as they did in other languages like Java.   
But certainly today that is not the case. I can name no less than five Common Lisp web servers off the top of my head (CL-HTTP, Hunchentoot, S-HTTP-Server, Araneida, AllegroServe), not to mention mod-lisp for Apache.  There must be nearly a dozen different web frameworks (KPAX, Weblocks, UncommonWeb, et al). And there are common lisp libraries for every web acronym you can name: SOAP, XML, XLST, FTP, XML-RPC, S3, AJAX.... ad infinitum.  And there are tools that have no analog in other languages, like the wonder of wonders ParenScript.

",,"The slow development of web libraries and protocols in Lisp compared to other languages can be attributed to several factors. First, Lisp is a versatile programming language with a focus on flexibility and expressiveness rather than rapid library development.

Second, the Lisp community has traditionally focused more on applications like artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and software engineering, which have different needs from web development. As a result, there was less initial investment in building out robust web frameworks. Additionally, the dynamic and evolving nature of web technologies might require frequent updates to libraries, which can be challenging to manage for any language, including Lisp.

"Is the values function in Common Lisp just syntactic sugar for packaging multiple values into a list that gets destructured by the caller?. I am asking because I thought Common Lisp supports ""true"" multiple value return rather than returning a tuple or a list as in other languages, such as python. Someone just told me that it's just syntactic sugar, so I would like someone to kindly explain it. To try to understand the type that is returned by the values function, I typed (type-of (values 1 2 3)), and the output was BIT. I searched in the Common Lisp reference for that and I couldn't find it mentioned in the datatypes section. Also, can anyone share some resources that suggest how the values function is implemented in Common Lisp?. Thank you.
","Multiple Values in CL
The language Common lisp
is described in the ANSI standard INCITS 226-1994 (R2004) and has many
implementations.
Each can implement multiple values
as it sees fit, and they are allowed, of course, to cons up a list for them
(in fact, the Emacs Lisp compatibility layer for CL does just
that -
but it is, emphatically and intentionally, not a Common Lisp implementation).
Purpose
However, the intent of this facility is to enable passing (at least
some) multiple values without consing (i.e., without allocating
heap memory) and all CL
implementations I know of do that.
In this sense the multiple values facility is an optimization.
Of course, the implementation of this feature can be very different for
different platforms and scenarios. E.g., the first few (say, 20 -
required by the standard) are
stored in a static of thread-local vector, the next several (1000?) are
allocated on the stack, and the rest (if needed) are allocated on the
heap as a vector or list.
Usage
E.g., the function floor returns two values.
If you write
(setq a (floor 10 3))

you capture only the first one and discard the second one, you need to
write
(setf (values q r) (floor 10 3))

to capture both values.  This is similar to what other
languages might express as
q,r = floor(10,3)

using tuples, except that CL does
not allocate memory to pass (just a few) multiple values, and the
other languages often do.
IOW, one can think of multiple values as an ephemeral struct.
Note that CL can convert multiple values to lists:
(destructuring-bind (q r) (multiple-value-list (floor 10 3))
  ; use q & r here
  ...)

instead of the more efficient and concise
(multiple-value-bind (q r) (floor 10 3)
  ; use q & r here
  ...)

MV & type
CL does not have a special type for the ""multiple value object""
exactly because it does not allocate a separate object to pass
around multiple values. In this sense one can, indeed, claim that
values is syntactic sugar.
However, in CL one can declare a
function type returning
multiple values:
(declaim (ftype (real &optional real) (values real real)) floor)

This means that floor returns two values, both
reals (as opposed to returning
a value of type (values real real)), i.e., in this case one might
claim abuse of notation.
Your case
In your specific case, type-of
is an ordinary function (i.e., not a macro or special operator).
You pass it a single object, 1, because, unless you are using
multiple-value-bind and
friends, only the first value is used, so
(type-of (values 1 2 3))

is identical to
(type-of 1)

and type of 1 is bit.
PS: Control return values
One use of values is to
control the return values of a function.
Normally a CL function's return values are those of the last form.
Sometimes it is not desirable, e.g., the last form return multiple
values and you want your function to return one value (or none,
like void in C):
(defun 2values (x y)
  (floor y x))
(defun 1value (x y)
  (values (floor y x)))
(defun no-values (x)
  (print x)
  (values))

",,"The `values` function in Common Lisp is indeed a form of syntactic sugar for returning multiple values. However, it's important to understand that Common Lisp does support 'true' multiple value return, which can be accessed using the special forms like `multiple-value-bind`, `multiple-value-list`, and others.

When you call `(type-of (values 1 2 3))` in Common Lisp, the result is `BIT`, which stands for 'bit-vector'. This is because when a list of values is created with `values`, it is converted to a bit vector internally. The reason this might not be explicitly mentioned in the datatypes section of the reference is that the `BIT` type typically refers to bit vectors used for low-level bitwise operations, and its use here is more about how Common Lisp handles multiple values under the hood rather than as a standard data type.

The `values` function essentially packages the specified arguments into a 'multiple value' object. This can then be deconstructed by various special forms designed to handle multiple values, such as `multiple-value-bind`, which allows you to bind these multiple values directly in your code.

For resources on how `values` and multiple values are implemented in Common Lisp:

"As a non-lisper coming to clojure how should I best understand the naming convention where vars get a name like *var-name*?
This appears to be a lisp convention indicating a global variable. But in clojure such vars appear in namespaces as far as I can tell. 
I would really appreciate a brief explanation of what I should expect when an author has used such vars in their code, ideally with a example of how and why such a var would be used and changed in a clojure library.
","It's a convention used in other Lisps, such as Common Lisp, to distinguish between special variables, as distinct from lexical variables. A special or dynamic variable has its binding stored in a dynamic environment, meaning that its current value as visible to any point in the code depends upon how it may have been bound higher up the call stack, as opposed to being dependent only on the most local lexical binding form (such as let or defn).
Note that in his book Let Over Lambda, Doug Hoyte argues against the ""earmuffs"" asterix convention for naming special variables. He uses an unusual macro style that makes reference to free variables, and he prefers not to commit to or distinguish whether those symbols will eventually refer to lexical or dynamic variables.
Though targeted specifically at Common Lisp, you might enjoy Ron Garret's essay The Idiot's Guide to Special Variables. Much of it can still apply to Clojure.
",,"In Clojure, the naming convention *var-name* is indeed related to global variables or dynamic vars. However, it's important to understand that while this syntax is used to reference such variables, in a well-structured Clojure application, these global variables are typically managed within namespaces and with more controlled scope. This means they can still be accessed globally but are part of the Clojure ecosystem.

For example, consider the `*print-length*` dynamic var which controls how many elements of a collection are printed when using `(pr-str)` or similar functions:

```clojure
(*print-length* 5) ;; Set *print-length* to 5

(pr-str (repeat 1000 'a)) ;; Only prints the first 5 elements due to the dynamic var setting
```

In this case, `*print-length*` is a global variable that can be changed anywhere in your codebase. However, it's best practice to use such variables with caution and only where truly necessary, as they affect the behavior of all code that uses them.

When an author has used such vars in their Clojure library or project, you should expect these variables to influence the runtime behavior of the system in a way that is not confined to just one function or namespace. Modifying these global settings can have wide-ranging effects on how your program behaves, so understanding and controlling these variables is crucial for maintaining the integrity and predictability of the application.",0.5276,[[0.41896572]],0.12158622968949878,0.3538510345261762,0.3384615384615385,0.020618556701030927,0.13846153846153844

","(nth 3 (list 1 2 3 4))

According to the HyperSpec:

Accessor NTH
Description:
nth locates the nth element of list, where the car of the list is the “zeroth” element. Specifically,
(nth n list) ==  (car (nthcdr n list))

Examples:
(nth 0 '(foo bar baz)) =>  FOO
(nth 1 '(foo bar baz)) =>  BAR
(nth 3 '(foo bar baz)) =>  NIL
(setq 0-to-3 (list 0 1 2 3)) =>  (0 1 2 3)
(setf (nth 2 0-to-3) ""two"") =>  ""two""

",,"In Lisp, you can create your own function or macro to achieve this. For example, you can define a simple function called `(item n list)` that uses `(first (nthcdr n list))` internally. Here’s how you might do it:

  (first (nthcdr n list)))

Now, you can use `(item 2 '(1 2 3 4))` to get the third element of the list, as Lisp is zero-indexed. To get the second element, you would call `(item 1 '(1 2 3 4))`.

Is there any way to force interpreter treat symbol as function if some lambda was bound to it? For example:
(setq y (lambda () ""I want to be a named function""))
(y)

P.S.: I'm using SBCL.
","Common Lisp has different namespaces for functions and values.
You define functions in the function namespace with DEFUN, FLET, LABELS and some others.
If you want to get a function object as a value, you use FUNCTION. 
(defun foo (x) (1+ x))

(function foo)   ->  #<the function foo>

or shorter:
#'foo    ->   #<the function foo>

If you want to call a function, then you write (foo 100).
If you want to call the function as a value then you need to use FUNCALL or APPLY:
(funcall #'foo 1)

You can pass functions around and call them:
(defun bar (f arg)
  (funcall f arg arg))

(bar #'+ 2)  ->  4

In the case of DEFUN:
It is not (setf (symbol-value 'FOO) (lambda ...)).
It is more like (setf (symbol-function 'foo) (lambda ...)).
Note that the two namespaces enable you to write:
(defun foo (list)
  (list list))

(foo '(1 2 3))  ->  ((1 2 3))

There is no conflict between the built-in function LIST and the variable LIST. Since we have two different namespaces we can use the same name for two different purposes.
Note also that in the case of local functions there is no symbol involved. The namespaces are not necessarily tied to symbols. Thus for local variables a function lookup via a symbol name is not possible.

"I was studying Lisp and I am not experienced in Lisp programming. In a part of my studies I encountered the below examples:
> (cons ‘a ‘(a b))  ----> (A A B)
> (cons ‘(a b) ‘a)  ----> ((A B).A)

I was wondering why when we have (cons ‘a ‘(a b)) the response is (A A B) and why when we change it a little and put the 'a after (a b), the response is a dotted list like ((A B).A)? What is the difference between the first code line and the second one? What is going on behind these codes?
","It's pretty easy to understand if you think of them as cons-cells.
In short, a cons cell consists of exactly two values. The normal notation for this is to use the dot, e.g.:
(cons 'a 'b) ==> (A . B)

But since lists are used so often in LISP, a better notation is to drop the dot.
Lists are made by having the second element be a new cons cell, with the last ending a terminator (usually nil, or '() in Common Lisp). So these two are equal:
(cons 'a (cons 'b '())) ==> (A B)
(list 'a 'b) ==> (A B)

So (cons 'a 'b) creates a cell [a,b], and (list 'a 'b) will create [a, [b, nil]].  Notice the convention for encoding lists in cons cells: They terminate with an inner nil.
Now, if you cons 'a onto the last list, you create a new cons cell containing [[a, [b, nil]], a]. As this is not a ""proper"" list, i.e. it's not terminated with a nil, the way to write it out is to use the dot: (cons '(a b) 'a) ==> ((a b) . a).
If the dot wasn't printed, it would have to have been a list with the structure [[a, [b, nil]], [a, nil]].
Your example
When you do (cons 'a '(a b)) it will take the symbol 'a and the list '(a b) and put them in a new cons cell.  So this will consist of [a, [a, [b, nil]]].  Since this naturally ends with an inner nil, it's written without dots.
As for (cons '(a b) 'a), now you'll get [[a, [b, nil]], a]. This does not terminate with an inner nil, and therefore the dot notation will be used.
Can we use cons to make the last example end with an inner nil? Yes, if we do
(cons '(a b) (cons 'a '())) ==> ((A B) A)

And, finally,
(list '(a b) 'a))

is equivalent to
(cons (cons (cons 'a (cons 'b '())) (cons 'a '())))

",,"In Lisp, `cons` constructs a pair (or cons cell) where the first argument becomes the car and the second argument becomes the cdr. Let's break down both examples:

1. `(cons ‘a ‘(a b))`: Here, 'a' is the first argument and '(a b)' is the second argument to `cons`. The `car` (first element) of the resulting list will be 'a', and the `cdr` (rest of the list) will be the entire list '(a b)'. Therefore, the result is `(A A B)` because it represents a pair where the first element (car) is 'a' and the second element (cdr) is another cons cell containing 'a' followed by 'b'.

2. `(cons ‘(a b) ‘a)`: In this case, `'(a b)` is the first argument to `cons` and 'a' is the second. The `car` of the resulting list will be `(a b)`, which is a cons cell itself (the first element), and the `cdr` will be 'a'. This results in `((A B).A)`, where `(A B)` is the car, and '.A' indicates that the cdr is a single element, 'a'.

The key difference between these two examples lies in which argument to `cons` is a cons cell (a list containing at least one pair). In the first example, '(a b)' is a cons cell, while in the second, 'a' is not. This distinction affects how `cons` interprets its arguments and constructs the resulting structure.",0.6073,[[0.52337456]],0.18358477274966734,0.27597432987236553,0.4385026737967915,0.16100178890876563,0.267379679144385
"Just started to learn LISP and I'm trying to figure out how to write the following recursive function.

And everything seems to work; however, it still works with lists of different lengths. I want it to just work with lists of numbers that have the same length. Where should I add code that returns ""invalid length"" should we have such?
","A simple way is to rewrite the function so that it checks different cases using the conditional form cond:
(defun dot-product (a b)
  (cond ((null a) (if (null b) 0 (error ""invalid length"")))
        ((null b) (error ""invalid length""))
        (t (+ (* (first a) (first b))
              (dot-product (rest a) (rest b))))))

In the first branch of the cond, if the first argument is NIL, the second one must be NIL as well, otherwise an error is generated. In the second branch, we already know that a is not NIL, so an error is immediately generated. Finally, the result is calculated.

One way to achieve this is by using external libraries or systems that support MIDI playback and interfacing with them from your Common Lisp code.

"Is there a way to pretty-print Lisp-style code string (in other words, a bunch of balanced parentheses and text within) in Python without re-inventing a wheel?
","Short answer
I think a reasonable approach, if you can, is to generate Python lists or custom objects instead of strings and use the pprint module, as suggested by @saulspatz.
Long answer
The whole question look like an instance of an XY-problem. Why? because you are using Python (why not Lisp?) to manipulate strings (why not data-structures?) representing generated Lisp-style code, where Lisp-style is defined as ""a bunch of parentheses and text within"".
To the question ""how to pretty-print?"", I would thus respond ""I wouldn't start from here!"".
The best way to not reinvent the wheel in your case, apart from using existing wheels, is to stick to a simple output format.
But first of all all, why do you need to pretty-print? who will look at the resulting code?
Depending on the exact Lisp dialect you are using and the intended usage of the code, you could format your code very differently. Think about newlines, indentation and maximum width of your text, for example.         The Common Lisp pretty-printer is particulary evolved and I doubt you want to have the same level of configurability.
    If you used Lisp, a simple call to pprint would solve your problem, but you are using Python, so stick with the most reasonable output for the moment because pretty-printing is a can of worms.
If your code is intended for human readers, please:

don't put closing parenthesis on their own lines
don't vertically align open and close parenthesis
don't add spaces between opening parenthesis

This is ugly:
 ( * ( + 3 x )
     (f 
        x
        y
     )
 )

This is better:
(* (+ 3 x)
   (f x y))

Or simply:
(* (+ 3 x) (f x y))

See here for more details.
But before printing, you have to parse your input string and make sure it is well-formed. Maybe you are sure it is well-formed, due to how you generate your forms, but I'd argue that the printer should ignore that and not make too many assumptions. If you passed the pretty-printer an AST represented by Python objects instead of just strings, this would be easier, as suggested in comments. You could build a data-structure or custom classes and use the pprint (python) module. That, as said above, seems to be the way to go in your case, if you can change how you generate your Lisp-style code.
With strings, you are supposed to handle any possible input and reject invalid ones.
This means checking that parenthesis and quotes are balanced (beware of escape characters), etc.
Actually, you don't need to really build an intermediate tree for printing (though it would probably help for other parts of your program), because Lisp-style code is made of forms that are easily nested and use a prefix notation: you can scan your input string from left-to-right and print as required when seeing parenthesis (open parenthesis: recurse; close parenthesis, return from recursion). When you first encounter an unescaped double-quote "", read until the next one "", ... 
This, coupled with a simple printing method, could be sufficient for your needs.
",,"Yes, you can pretty-print Lisp-style code strings in Python without reinventing the wheel. One popular library for this purpose is `parso`, which is used primarily for parsing and manipulating Python source code but can be adapted to handle other syntaxes as well. Another option is using a combination of regular expressions and a stack-based approach to correctly format the parentheses. However, if you want a more sophisticated solution, you might consider using a parser generator like `lpeg` or `ply` to parse the Lisp-like code and then use a formatting library to pretty-print it.",0.5334,[[0.5235878]],0.002982870535751124,0.0797271500608844,0.21647819063004844,0.042139384116693684,0.1098546042003231

Since they aren't the same structure either, I can't assume they will be the same, structurally at least. Any explanation how this works?
Edit: Sorry, I forgot to say why I am comparing. The second list is to suppose to bind the number to everywhere where those variables exists in the first list. So the resulting first list should be:

","That's kind of an odd comparison. It's a bit like asking ""what can a petrol car do that a diesel generator cannot?"" Er, well, those aren't really the same class of thing...
Lisp macros [which I know almost nothing about] allow you to do compile-time meta-programming. You can use that to achieve all sorts of useful things, from eliminating a bit of boilerplate code to virtually defining an entire new programming language.
Haskell monads are a useful way to structure certain kinds of computations. They make it easy to do certain things which are otherwise a bit tedious. (E.g., checking the result of each and every function to make sure it succeeded before running the next function.) All of this is a run-time thing, though; it has nothing to do with compile-time code generation.
",,"Macros in Lisp indeed have the power to manipulate code at compile time, which can be used to implement complex concepts such as monads. However, macros are not a one-size-fits-all solution and require careful design to handle the intricacies of functional constructs like monads effectively. Monads themselves are primarily a concept from functional programming that provide a way to chain operations in a sequence while handling side effects or computations in a more structured manner.\n\nHere's an example of how you might implement a simple monad-like structure using macros in Common Lisp:\n```lisp\n(defmacro bind (var expr &body body)\n  `(let ((,var ,expr))\n     ,@body))\n\n(bind m1 (make-monad-obj)\n  (bind result (process-maybe-nil m1)\n    (if result\n        (do-something-with result)\n        (do-something-else))))\n```\nIn this example, `bind` is a macro that allows you to chain operations in a monadic style. However, the actual implementation of `make-monad-obj`, `process-maybe-nil`, `do-something-with`, and `do-something-else` would need to be provided separately and correctly handle the concept of monads.\n\nWhile macros can help encapsulate this behavior, they cannot inherently understand or enforce all the properties of monads without additional context and logic within the Lisp code.",0.5064,[[0.36363881]],0.09688213112657246,0.3337415799142682,0.3631284916201118,0.02808988764044944,0.15083798882681565

","You are misusing defvar:

It should never be used inside a function, use let instead or just (nth index providedList) instead of currCharacter.

It defines a new global variable, and only sets it if it has not been set yet, so it sets

You also do not really need return-from, and your code
would be more readable if use used dashes instead of camel case.
E.g.,
(defun print-list-elements-recursively (list)

","I'm fairly new to Clojure, but I'll try to explain you what's happening here. Quoting and backquoting are different in how they treat symbols. For example, you can write similar code that result in subtle differences:
user=> '(+ foo 2)
(+ foo 2)
user=> `(+ foo 2)
(clojure.core/+ user/foo 2)

Note how just using backquote ""binds"" the symbols to the corresponding namespace (clojure.core for + and user for foo). In the contrary, quoting just treats the symbol as-is. If you want to correctly write your broken function, you can use the list syntax:
(defmacro broken-example [bar]
  (list '+ 'foo bar))

(defn broken-function [foo]
  (broken-example 1))

(broken-function 2)

Now broken-function outputs the expected result. 
EDIT:
Now thanks to A. Webb comment below, you can also avoid the namespace binding by using this syntax:
(defmacro broken-example [bar]
  `(+ ~'foo ~bar))

",,"The issue with your `broken-example` macro is that it's trying to use a variable `foo`, which is not bound within the scope of the macro. In macros, the backtick syntax (`) and the tilde (~) are used for splicing and evaluating forms at macro expansion time. When you write `(defmacro broken-example [bar] '(+ foo ~bar))`, it's expecting `foo` to be a literal symbol that should remain as is (unexpanded), but in this case, it tries to evaluate `foo` as if it were a form, which fails because `foo` is not defined at the macro expansion time.\n\nTo make your `broken-example` macro work similarly to `working-example`, you need to pass `foo` explicitly. You can modify your macro definition like this:\n\n```clojure\n(defmacro broken-example [bar & [foo]]\n  `(+ ,foo ~bar))\n```\nNow, when you call `(broken-example 1 foo)`, it will work as expected and replace the symbol `foo` in the form. However, if you want to pass a function or another value that provides the value of `foo`, you need to ensure that this value is provided.\n\nAlternatively, if your intention is simply to add `bar` to whatever value `foo` holds without re-binding it, you can directly reference `foo` within the macro body as follows:\n\n```clojure\n(defmacro broken-example [bar]\n  `(,+ foo ~bar))\n```\nThis way, the `foo` symbol is not evaluated at macro expansion time but rather left as a literal symbol to be resolved when the resulting form is executed.",0.5904,[[0.56487524]],0.17480036352642483,0.376495055731314,0.37185929648241206,0.11616161616161615,0.19095477386934673
"Is there in Scala some language construction like lisp's progn?

","Yep, curly braces.
progn evaluates forms, in the order in which they are given.

The values of each form but the last are discarded.

Examples:

 (progn 1 2 3) =>  3
 (progn (values 1 2 3)) =>  1, 2, 3
 (setq a 1) =>  1

scala> {1; 2; 3}
// warnings omitted
// res1: Int = 3

"Does anybody know how to implement method_missing (à la Ruby) in Clojure?
E.g.
(defn method_missing [name & args]

It would be very useful for a DSL, if used correctly.
Thanks in advance!
","In Ruby, method_missing is one of the primary constructs for metaprogramming. It's tightly bound to Ruby's object oriented structure, dynamically creating methods in a class from 'metaclasses'. This can be done because in Ruby classes are objects too.
Since Clojure is a functional language, mimicking this Rubyism makes little sense. However, one of the basic idioms of Lisps (such as Clojure), is that code is data: and as code can generate data, it can generate code also. The primary way to do this metaprogramming in Lisp is macros.
I'd suggest reading more about macros and their dos and don'ts. Be advised though that just like in Ruby, dynamically generated code is generally harder to debug and maintain. Often clever use of other functional idioms can be a better structural solution.
",,"Clojure does not have a direct equivalent of Ruby's `method_missing` method. However, you can achieve similar functionality using various approaches:

1. **Using Var or Defn**: You can define a dynamic var that captures the missing methods and handles them accordingly.
2. **Using Macros**: You can create macros to generate functions on-the-fly when a missing method is called.
3. **Using Clojure's Exception Handling**: You can catch `NoSuchSymbolException` which is thrown when a symbol lookup fails.

Here’s an example of how you might implement something similar using Var and a macro:

"I'm aware that Common Lisp has different binding environments for functions and variables, but I believe that it also has another binding environment for tagbody labels. Are there even more binding environments than this?  If so, then is it fair to categorize Common Lisp as a Lisp-2?
These question are not meant as pedantry or bike-shedding, I only want to gain a better understanding of Common Lisp and hopefully get some pointers into where to dig deeper into its spec.
","
I'm aware that Common Lisp has different binding environments for
  functions and variables,

That would be namespaces, according to the HyperSpec:

namespace n. 1. bindings whose denotations are restricted to a
  particular kind. The bindings of names to tags is the tag
  namespace.'' 2. any mapping whose domain is a set of names.A
  package defines a namespace.''

(Point 1.)

but I believe that it also has another binding environment for tagbody
  labels. Are there even more binding environments than this?

Yes, there are more namespaces. I even remember a little snippet exposing most of them, but unfortunately, I can't find it anymore¹. It at least exposed variable, function, tag, and block namespaces, but maybe also types and declarations were included. There is also another SO answer that lists these namespaces.

If so, then is it fair to categorize Common Lisp as a Lisp-2?

In the comments to the above linked answer, Rainer Joswig agrees that the ""general debate is about Lisp-1 against Lisp-n"".
The ""2"" might be due to the relative importance of the distinction between value and function slots, or because the objects of the other namespaces aren't first-class objects. For example in the Gabriel/Pitman paper referenced in the other answer:

There is really a larger number of namespaces than just the two that
  are discussed here. As we noted earlier, other namespaces include at
  least those of blocks and tags; type names and declaration names are
  often considered namespaces. Thus, the names Lisp1 and Lisp2, which we
  have been using are misleading. The names Lisp5 and Lisp6 might be
  more appropriate.

and:

In this paper, there are two namespaces of concern, which we
  shall term the ""value namespace"" and the ""function namespace."" Other
  namespaces include tag names (used by TAGBODY and GO) and block names
  (used by BLOCK and RETURN-FROM), but the objects in the location parts
  of their bindings are not first-class Lisp objects.


¹) PAIP, p. 837:
(defun f (f)
  (block f
    (tagbody
     f (catch 'f
         (if (typep f 'f)
             (throw 'f (go f)))
         (funcall #'f (get (symbol-value 'f) 'f))))))

",,"Common Lisp does indeed have multiple binding environments beyond functions and variables. Tagbody labels are a specific type of lexical binding environment used within `tagbody`, `go`, and `block` constructs. Common Lisp is generally categorized as a Lisp-2 language, where free variables (those not bound in the current function) are in a separate namespace from local variables. This categorization distinguishes it from Lisp-1 languages like Scheme, where these namespaces overlap.

In addition to lexical bindings for functions and variables, Common Lisp also supports dynamic bindings through special forms and macros. For example, `let` provides lexical binding, while `setq` (and other similar macros) provide dynamic binding within the scope of their execution.

To dig deeper into the specifics of Common Lisp's multiple binding environments, you might want to explore the Common Lisp HyperSpec or consult relevant sections in books such as ",0.5496,[[0.45313667]],0.04600702561518629,0.14891616112595948,0.31388329979879276,0.0808080808080808,0.1529175050301811
"I found a LISP 1.5 Manual with some code in it.
This one is from Section 1.2
Examples

    cons[A;B]=(A . B)

From reading through the manual it looks like the function cons is taking two atoms as input arguments, A and B, and outputting an S-expression, (A . B).
Question:
How do I put the code cons[A;B] in a repl, run it, and see the output (A . B)?
I'm expecting to do something like:
~ $ lisp1.5
> cons[A;B]
=> (A . B)

For example, if I went to https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ and saw some code, I would copy it, type irb into my shell and paste it.

~ $ irb
irb(main):001:0> puts ""Hello World!""
Hello World!
=> nil

","Section 1.2 of the manual explains that this is only a notation, used to help readers distinguish between functions and S-expressions (emphasis mine).

We shall introduce some elementary functions of S-expressions. To distinguish
  the functions from the S-expressions themselves, we shall write function names in
  I lower case letters, since atomic symbols consist of only upper case letters. Furthermore,
  the arguments of functions will be grouped in square brackets rather than
  parentheses. As a separator or punctuation mark we shall use the semicolon. 

It is followed by an example:
cons[A ; B] = (A . B)

The manual introduces Lisp, its evaluation model, the compiler, etc. 
The above is the mathematical definition of cons, where A and B are metavariables: for all values A and B, the application of cons on A and B is a cons-cell where the CAR part is A and the CDR part B. If someone developed a denotational semantics to express Ruby's evaluation model, you would have the same kind of definitions. You can convert this notation if you want, i.e. you write (cons 1 2) to test it concretely. But the 1.5 manual is arguably not the best starting point for learning Common Lisp, as standardized since 1994. You could try the following ones, instead:

Notice that you cannot just call (geometric) safely in REPL as it will  try to evaluate an infinite sequence.
",,"The issue arises from how `cons` works with numbers in Clojure. When you use `(* n 1/2)`, it results in a `java.lang.Long` for the initial call and continues as `java.lang.Double` for subsequent calls, but there's an implicit coercion that causes problems when combining them into a sequence. In your case, `cons` creates a list with elements of different types (a `Long` initially and then `Double`s), which can lead to issues with lazy sequences and their evaluation.\n\nTo fix this, you should ensure consistent type handling throughout the sequence definition. You can do this by explicitly converting the result of `(* n 1/2)` to a fraction using `(/ n 2)`. Here's how your function could be adjusted:\n```clojure\n(defn geometric []\n  (lazy-seq (cons 1 (geometric (/ 1 2)))))\n```\nor\n```clojure\n(defn geometric [n]\n  (cons n (lazy-seq (geometric (* n 1/2)))))\n```\nWith these changes, the sequence will be properly formed as fractions or doubles from the start, and `take` should work as expected without any errors.",0.5823,[[0.39107138]],0.23458360860013353,0.38818159127207746,0.4217687074829932,0.136986301369863,0.1836734693877551
"I wonder why in the following code, d is not being consed into x.

Thank you!
","I don't know a lot about LISP, but here's a few things I think I know that might help you:

(cons d x) doesn't put d ""into"" x; it creates a new value that consists of d, followed by the contents of x. If x is a list, then (cons d x) will also be a list.
(cons d x) doesn't change anything; it creates a value, but if you don't capture that value, it gets discarded again. In particular, that expression doesn't change x.

",,"In your code, `x` is not being modified because the `cons` function returns a new list that includes the consed element, but it does not modify the original list. You need to capture the result of the `cons` operation and assign it back to `x`. Here’s how you can modify your code:\n\n```lisp\n(defun it (x) \n  (setq f '(a b c))\n  (let ((result x)) ; Create a reference variable for x\n    (dolist (d f)\n      (setf result (cons d result))) ; Modify the result instead of x directly\n    (reverse result))) ; Reverse the list to get the correct order\n(print (it '())) ; Example call, it should print (c b a)\n```\nThis way, `x` remains unchanged in the original scope, and you build the new list correctly.",0.5373,[[0.24288235]],0.10561243865368353,0.33359555070313446,0.34080717488789236,0.054298642533936646,0.15246636771300448
"As I've started learning about lisp, emacs, and ess (Emacs Speaks Statistics), I've come across this concept of inferior-this-or-that. For instance, there's an inferior-ess-mode, inferior-lisp, and Inferior Emacs Lisp Mode.
In all these cases, it seems that some interpreted language is running within emacs, and you can interact with it within a buffer. But why are they inferior and what are they inferior to?
","An inferior mode refers to a mode which run as a subprocess of emacs.  
For example, this is my process tree when I start emacs:
$ pstree 62238
--= 62238 smt /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/HEAD/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs

After I run an inferior tcl shell, this is what my process tree looks like:
$ pstree 62238
-+= 62238 smt /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/HEAD/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs
 \-+= 62359 smt /bin/sh /usr/bin/wish
   \--- 62361 smt /usr/bin/../../System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Version

Another way of saying this might be that ""inferior"" is synonymous with the prefix ""sub-"" in this context.
",,"In Emacs, the term 'inferior' refers to a subprocess or an interactive process that is running within the context of another program. In this case, it means that these modes are interfaces through which you can interact with an interpreted language (like R for ESS or Lisp) while being inside Emacs.

The concept of 'inferior' in these contexts does not imply inferiority but rather a subordinate relationship where the process is controlled and managed by Emacs. When you use `inferior-ess-mode`, `inferior-lisp`, or `Inferior Emacs Lisp Mode`, you are running an instance of the respective language interpreter (E.g., R, Scheme) as a subprocess within Emacs.

These modes provide features such as:

1. **Interaction**: You can send code snippets to the running process for immediate evaluation.
2. **Completion**: Get completion suggestions and help documentation for commands or functions in the target language.
3. **Debugging**: Set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, etc., directly from within Emacs.

So, they are not inferior but rather a means to integrate the power of an interpreted language into the powerful text editing and development environment that is Emacs.",0.5125,[[0.29098768]],0.07911519759800469,0.2841461548593034,0.2837370242214533,0.04181184668989547,0.11764705882352941
"I want to know how to embed a lisp interpreter into a gui application, i.e. something like what pyshell does for Python.
","Some options:

Write the complete application including the GUI in Lisp: lots of Lisp systems support that
Write the application in Lisp and link C code to it, if you need to call some external GUI libraries: Lisp systems can load and call C (and compatible) libraries.
Embed Lisp into your application: ECL (Embeddable Common Lisp) is an obvious choice. LispWorks (commercial) and Allegro CL (commercial) can deliver Lisp code as shared libraries. You can then load such a shared library into your program.

",,"To embed a Lisp interpreter into a GUI application similar to how PyShell works with Python, you can use several approaches depending on your specific needs and preferences. One common method is to use an embedded Common Lisp system like CMUCL or SBCL in combination with a toolkit for building GUIs such as GTK+ or Qt.\n\nHere’s a basic outline of the process using GTK+ in Common Lisp (SBCL):\n1. Install GTK+ development libraries and headers on your system.\n2. Set up SBCL to use the GTK+ bindings, which can be done through packages like `cl-gtk2` for SBCL.\n3. Write a GUI application that initializes the GTK+ environment, creates a main window, and embeds an interactive Lisp session or REPL.\n4. Use the GTK+ event loop to handle user interactions with the GUI elements while the embedded interpreter runs in the background.\n\nHere is a simple example using SBCL and `cl-gtk2`:\n```lisp\n(require 'cl-gtk2)\n\n(defun main-window (app)\n  (let ((window (gtk-window-new :toplevel))\n        (entry (gtk-entry-new)))\n    (gtk-container-add window entry)\n    (g-signal-connect window \",0.5179,[[0.31542767]],0.0701757311353309,0.32644434006575856,0.29818181818181816,0.029304029304029304,0.12363636363636364

"I'm trying to emulate Lisp-like list in JavaScript (just an exercise with no practical reason), but I'm struggling to figure out how to best represent an empty list.
Is an empty list just a nil value or is it under the hood stored in a cons cell?
I can:
(car '())
NIL
(cdr '())
NIL

but an empty list for sure can not be (cons nil nil), because it would be indistinguishable from a list storing a single nil. It would need to store some other special value.
On the other hand, if an empty list is not built from a cons cell, it seems impossible to have a consistent high-level interface for appending a single value to an existing list. A function like:
(defun append-value (list value) ...

Would modify its argument, but only if it is not an empty list, which seems ugly.
","An empty list is simply the nil symbol (and symbols, by definition, are not conses). car and cdr are defined to return nil if given nil.
As for list-mutation functions, they return a value that you are supposed to reassign to your variable. For example, look at the specification for the nreverse function: it may modify the given list, or not, and you are supposed to use the return value, and not rely on it to be modified in-place.
Even nconc, the quintessential destructive-append function, works that way: its return value is the appended list that you're supposed to use. It is specified to modify the given lists (except the last one) in-place, but if you give it nil as the first argument, it can't very well modify that, so you still have to use the return value.
",,"In JavaScript, you can represent a Lisp-like empty list using `null` or `{}` (an empty object), but since you want to maintain consistency with Lisp's cons cells and avoid modifying arguments, it’s better to use `null`. This is because an empty list in Lisp is indeed represented as `(cons nil nil)`, which evaluates to `nil`.

If you represent the empty list as `null` or `{}`, then when you append a value, you can construct a new non-empty list by using `cons`. For example:

```javascript
function cons(head, tail) {
  return { head: head, tail: tail };
}

function appendValue(list, value) {
  if (list === null) {
    return cons(value, null);
  } else {
    const head = list.head;
    const tail = list.tail;
    return cons(head, appendValue(tail, value));
  }
}

// Example usage:
const emptyList = null;
const newNonEmptyList = appendValue(emptyList, 'a'); // { head: 'a', tail: null }
```

This way, you can maintain a consistent interface for appending values to lists and ensure that `nil` or an empty object is only used to represent true emptiness. This approach also avoids the need to modify the original list when appending.",0.528,[[0.3736409]],0.12533665486651321,0.3534743202416918,0.39999999999999997,0.06289308176100629,0.17500000000000002

--> ((0) (0) (0 0 3 0) (0 1 3) (0 1 5) (0 1 5) (0 3 0) (1) (1) (2) (2 7 19))

","Start by defining a function that determines whether one list is less than another.  The following example assumes that the lists can only contain numbers:
(defun list< (a b)
  (cond ((null a) (not (null b)))
        ((null b) nil)
        ((= (first a) (first b)) (list< (rest a) (rest b)))
        (t (< (first a) (first b))) ))

Armed with this function, you can now sort the list of lists.
(sort (copy-seq list) #'list<)

",,"To sort a list with sublists based on all elements of the sublist, you need to define a key function that concatenates all elements of the sublist into a single value. For example, you can use `apply` and `append` along with `string` or any other comparable type (like numbers) to achieve this. Here is how you can do it:

```lisp

}

Or do a sys.exit(0) in python. Is there a way to do this in DrRacket / Scheme? As often I will have a workbook with a few hundred lines of code and I only want the top few functions to run before exiting. For example:
#lang sicp

(define (filtr function sequence)
  (if (null? sequence) nil
      (let ((this (car sequence))
            (rest (cdr sequence)))
        (if (function this) (cons this (filtr function rest))

(exit)  ; ?? something like this I can drop in to terminate execution?

...200 more lines of code...

Is there a way to do that here?
","#lang racket can do that with the function named... exit. Try:
#lang racket

(display 1)
(exit 0)
(display 2)

#lang sicp doesn't have exit, but you can require it from Racket:
#lang sicp

(#%require (only racket exit))

(display 1)
(exit 0)
(display 2)

Early return from a function can be done using continuation. For example, with the let/cc operator:
#lang racket

(define (fact x)
  (let/cc return
    (if (= x 0)
        1
        (begin
          (display 123)
          (return -1)
          (display 456)
          (* x (fact (- x 1)))))))

(fact 10)
;; display 123
;; and return -1

Or equivalently, with call-with-current-continuation, which exists in both #lang racket and #lang sicp:
(define (fact x)
  (call-with-current-continuation
   (lambda (return)
     (if (= x 0)
         1
         (begin
           (display 123)
           (return -1)
           (display 456)
           (* x (fact (- x 1))))))))

",,"Yes, you can achieve short-circuiting or early termination in DrRacket/Scheme by using an `(exit)` expression. However, note that `(exit)` will terminate the current execution context and is commonly used in scripts or interactive sessions rather than within a function body. If you want to exit from within a function, consider throwing an exception that can be caught elsewhere. For your specific example, you could modify the `filtr` function like this:

```scheme
#lang sicp

(define (filtr function sequence)
  (if (null? sequence) nil
      (let ((this (car sequence))
            (rest (cdr sequence)))
        (if (function this) (cons this (filtr function rest))
            (filtr function rest)))))
  
(filtr (lambda (x) (> x 5)) '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9))

;; To terminate execution early, you can use an exception or simply ensure that the sequence is exhausted.
(exit)
```

If you want to run only the top few functions and then exit in a larger program, you might need to structure your code differently. One approach is to define a main function that calls the necessary functions and then exits:

```scheme
#lang sicp

(define (main)
  (filtr (lambda (x) (> x 5)) '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9))
  
  ;; Exit after calling filtr
  (exit))

;; Call the main function to run your program
(main)

"I am looking for a version of Scheme or even LISP that I can use to recover some lost Lisp development skills.  Some web capabilities would be nice but not essential. 
I've looked at Plt and MIT scheme and, while both look pretty good, the Plt seems to be more feature rich.  I've also looked at Lisp implementations but all of the seem quite expensive.
I favor free/inexpensive implementations as this is truly likely to just be occasional hobby programming. What recommendations would you have?
","I'd go with Racket. It may not be as fast as SBCL, but it does have excellent libraries and documentation, as well as an integrated environment that's designed to get you developing and running Scheme programs right out of the gate. What I really like about Racket's IDE, DrRacket, is what you don't have to do—you don't have to learn Emacs, you don't have to learn SLIME, you don't have to worry about hunting down third-party libraries, as virtually all libraries meant for Racket can be found in packages. All in all, it really cuts down on the learning curve and allows you to focus on the actual task at hand: writing great code.
Also, it comes with a web server if you want to make Racket-powered websites (which I'm currently looking into).

However, it does not have as many built-in features compared to more comprehensive Scheme environments like PLT Scheme.

If you prefer a more feature-rich environment and still want something free, GNU Guile is another excellent choice. It integrates well with the GNU system and has good support for extensions and modules. It also has strong web capabilities through its JavaScript FFI and can be used to create web applications using frameworks like WebKit-GTK.

The condition for it, simply is: 
(and (listp lst) (listp (first lst))
     (eq (first (first lst)) 'or))

And the transformer:
(append (remove-or (rest (first lst)))
        (remove-or (rest lst)))

So this brings us to the your function with slightly modified third condition branch:
(defun remove-or (lst)
  (cond ((null lst) lst)

But this function will not handle a one special case: the or in the very beginning of the list: (OR a b (or (or c d) e)). But having an additional condition branch like ((and (listp x) (eq (first x) 'or)) (remove-or (cdr x))) we will remove also ors acting like a variables: (a b or c or).
So this case must be handled separately, for instance:

"I have written the following macro, that defines records with a custom string representation.
(defmacro defrecord*

  `(defrecord ~rname [~@args]

However what toString returns is not quite what I am expecting.
(defrecord* Foo [bar baz]) 
(.toString (Foo. 3 4))

> ""class user.Foo(bar: 3, baz: 4)""

I'd like my toString to return Foo(bar: 3, baz: 4) in this case. What change do I need to make to get a string representation in this format?
Also what changes, if any, should I make to the above code to make it more idiomatic?
","Just replace ~rname with '~rname - you want the actual symbol Foo, not its value in the current scope, which is the class user.Foo.
You also have (apply concat) and (interpose "", "") in the wrong order - you'll be treating "", "" as a sequence, and adding \, and \space characters instead of a single string. Once you swap that, it becomes clear that you want mapcat instead of (apply concat (map ...)). So I'd replace your whole let-block with something like:
`(str '~rname
      ""("" ~@(interpose "", ""
                       (mapcat (fn [arg] [(str arg "": "") arg])
                               args))
      "")"")

Or if you really want to grind out that performance, you can compute ~(str ""("" rname) at compile-time instead of at runtime.
Please note, though, that as of Clojure 1.3 records already print in a way very similar to this, so if you're just doing this to make debugging easy, don't bother. If you're doing it because you're using .toString's output later on down the line...well, shame on whoever wrote that code, as .toString is mostly for debugging stuff.
",,"To achieve the desired string representation format and make your macro more idiomatic, you need to ensure that the `toString` method is correctly formatted.

My problem is that I cannot keep the first element and compare it with the others.
","Your function indented correctly looks like this:
(defun foo (lst) 
  (cond ((null lst) 0) 
        (car = k)              ; strange cond term

I have commented the second term in your cond. It is quite strange. It first evaluates the variable car (not the function #'car). If car is not nil it first evaluates the variable = (not the function #'=) and since it is not the last consequent expression in the cond term it throws that away and returns the last which is k. 
Secondly you write that you say you use the first element as comparison, however you call it k in your function but it is not defined anywhere. You need to do something before you do the recursion and thus you cannot let the actual function do the recursion since it will take the first element each time. Here is where labels can be used:
;; didn't call it foo since it's not very descriptive
(defun count-larger-than-first (list)
  (let ((first (car list)))
    (labels ((helper (list)
               (cond ((null list) 0)

                     (t (helper (cdr list))))))

Of course. Since you now have  the possibility to add more arguments I would have added an accumulator:
(defun count-larger-than-first (list)
  (let ((first (car list)))
    (labels ((helper (list acc)

                     (t (helper (cdr list) acc)))))
      (helper (cdr list) 0))))

And of course recursion might blow the stack so you should really write it without in Common Lisp:
(defun count-larger-than-first (list)
  (let ((first (car list)))
    (loop :for element :in (cdr list)
          :counting (> element first))))

Also, Emacs Lisp doesn't have return-from. Just say intermediate instead of (return-from tailfact intermediate). You do have to move the tailfact call within the if expression though, as the else clause.
Oh, in my testing, I found another point of difference between Common Lisp and Emacs Lisp: the latter doesn't support a default value for optional arguments, and it always uses nil. So here's one way to port your code to elisp:

"When I started learning CL from Practical Common Lisp, as is preached in the book, I started off with Allegro CL compiler. I stopped using it, since its commerical, yet free bit didn't impress me. It needed a connection to its remote server for some licensing stuffs.
I switched to 'clisp' and am using it. Now, I have been hearing about SBCL and planning to start using it as well.
So, the question is: How do the various ANSI CL implementations differ? Any practical experience of using one over the other ?
Thank you.
","There are portions of ANSI CL that leave certain details up to the implementations to determine; you will find that for those parts of the standard, each implementation will have its own quirks.
Also, look for things that are important to the runtime but not defined in the language: things like threading and multiprocessing and garbage collection will vary substantially in performance and reliability.
I have found SBCL to be the easiest implementation to work with in Linux; it has good support for threading in Linux.  I can't say much about the garbage collector, because it hasn't mattered to me much yet.
On Windows, your best bet will probably be Allegro or LispWorks, although I've had some success with clisp on Windows.  The Windows port of SBCL is progressing, but I haven't used it much, so I can't really comment.
Generally speaking, an understanding of these kinds of things that are difficult to acquire through research or analysis; it comes through experience.  Just pick a decent implementation that you're comfortable with, and get to work.  You'll figure out the tricky stuff as you go.
",,"Various ANSI Common Lisp (CL) implementations like Allegro CL, Clisp, and SBCL differ in several aspects such as performance, features, development tools, and licensing. Here are some practical differences and experiences with them:

1. **Allegro CL**: Developed by Franz Inc., Allegro CL is a commercial implementation of ANSI Common Lisp known for its powerful optimization capabilities and comprehensive IDE support. It is particularly strong in areas like object-oriented programming, concurrency, and performance tuning. However, it requires an active connection to their server for licensing purposes, which some users find inconvenient.

2. **Clisp**: Clisp (Common Lisp Interactive System Processor) is a free implementation that adheres closely to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. It is suitable for development of both small scripts and large applications due to its stability and adherence to the language specification. However, it may not always be as fast or have as many advanced features compared to other commercial implementations like SBCL.

3. **SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp)**: SBCL is a free implementation that focuses on speed and compatibility with ANSI CL standards. It includes an optimizing compiler and just-in-time (JIT) compiler, making it highly performant for most applications. SBCL also has good support for large memory spaces and garbage collection. Many developers prefer SBCL for its speed and reliability.

In practical terms, if you value performance and advanced features, SBCL is a great choice. It’s widely used in production environments due to its robustness and fast execution speeds. Clisp might be more suitable if you need adherence to standards with less emphasis on performance. Allegro CL offers a powerful environment but comes at a cost.

If you're looking for a free option that balances speed and features, SBCL is often recommended by many experienced Common Lisp developers.",0.5732,[[0.40554405]],0.1561051702438829,0.34561750006413333,0.3209876543209877,0.06611570247933884,0.13991769547325103
"In Common Lisp, there are obviously some special characters that act as shortcuts for certain forms. 'x means (quote x). #'f means (function f). I had thought those (as well as backtick) were the only ones, but then I learned about #(), which is apparently a vector, and just today someone mentioned #., which apparently does something with evaluation time.
Try as I might, I can't seem to find a comprehensive list of which prefix symbols mean something and what they do? Is this something that's left to the implementation to decide, or could someone point me to somewhere in the standard that lists these shortcuts comprehensively?
","The HyperSpec, in 2.4 Standard Macro Characters, enumerates ""the macro characters defined initially in a conforming implementation"".  You can define your own using set-macro-character, which handles the types like ' which have no ""prefix"" to them, and set-dispatch-macro-character, which handles the type that are prefixed by a dispatch character (typically #). 
In addition to the HyperSpec, you may find Chapter 17, Read Macros from Paul Graham's On Lisp helpful.  It begins with an implementation of ', i.e., the macro character that expands to (quote ...).  Answers to How to define symbols that will work like ( and ) by symbol macro? are also helpful, as there are some uses of set-macro-character.
",,"In Common Lisp, certain prefix characters are used to introduce special forms. These are standardized and defined in the language specification rather than left to implementation discretion. A comprehensive list of such prefix characters can be found in Section 3.1.2 Lexical Translations of the ANSI Common Lisp standard.

Some commonly known examples include:
- `': Quote form (e.g., 'x is equivalent to (quote x))
- #': Various forms like function, vector, and reader macros (e.g., #(1 2 3) creates a vector)
- #: Package qualifier
- ##: Line number directive

For the specific case of `#.` (dot), it's used in read tables to indicate that a particular form should be evaluated during read-time. More details on this can be found in the section discussing reader macros and readtables.

"In The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs part 3.2, an ""environment"" is defined as ""a sequence of frames.""  But as far as I can see, the book doesn't further discuss the difference between an environment and a frame.  Also, I suspect the drawings of environments conflates them with frames because books drawings are small and 2-D, and don't readily show time-evolution short of another full drawing.  
So would it be correct to think of an environment at creation as being the same as its first frame?  And then when any change occurs in the environment (an extant binding changed, a new binding created), the environment adds a new frame to its sequence of frames?  If that understanding is NOT correct, then what exactly is the difference between an environment and a frame?
Thanks in advance for any help!
","The sequence of frames is the linked list (of frames) pointing 'upwards' towards the global environment.  So when an environment is created (for example, in the context of a procedure binding), the 'environment' is a pointer to the frame...which in term points to the enclosing environment (or null, if the global environment).
So ... a qualified 'yes'...it's the first frame in the sense that the rest of the environment is accessible from that first frame.
Does that help?
Cordially,

",,"Your understanding is largely correct. In the context of The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP), an environment is indeed a sequence of frames. When you create an environment, it starts with one frame, which contains the initial bindings. As new bindings are created or existing ones are modified, a new frame is added to the sequence, effectively creating a snapshot of the current state. This new frame encapsulates all the bindings that have been defined up to that point in time.

To clarify further:

- An **environment** is a collection (a sequence) of frames.
- A **frame** is a container for variable bindings at a particular point in time.

The environment maintains a history by adding new frames when changes occur, which allows you to trace the evolution of the state over time.

","(defun strcat (&rest args)

",,"In Common Lisp, you can handle variable arguments using the `&rest` parameter. This allows you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function and collect them into a list. Here’s how you can implement your `strcat` function that mimics the behavior of `concatenate 'string ...` with variable arguments:\n\n```lisp\n(defun strcat (&rest args)\n  (apply #'concatenate 'string args))\n```\n\nIn this implementation, `&rest args` collects all the arguments into a list called `args`, and then `(apply #'concatenate 'string args)` calls `concatenate` with `'string` as the first argument and all elements of `args` as subsequent string arguments.\n\nThis way, you can call `(strcat ",0.5718,[[0.46620859]],0.08462443006322,0.2709764978851427,0.13675213675213677,0.10434782608695652,0.13675213675213677
"How to know if a function evaluates its arguments?
Setq seems not to evaluate its arguments but 
Break 15 [16]> (setq j (kjl klj))
*** - EVAL: undefined function KJL

So when is the evaluation done?
cond and and seem not to evaluate their arguments as well but...
Break 18 [19]> (cond ((eql nil nil) (write ""lkj"")))
""lkj""
""lkj""
Break 18 [19]> (cond ((eql nil (not nil)) (write ""lkj""))
NIL

in the example above cond has to evaluate (eql nil nil) to know if it's true or not, hasn't it?
","Theory: Form Evaluation
Functions
The runtime evaluates the arguments before passing them to a function (such as eql).
E.g., when you write (eql a 1), the function eql gets the value of the variable a and the value of the literal 1 which is itself.
Macros
The runtime does not evaluate the arguments of macros (such as cond and and).
Macros convert their arguments to code which is then evaluated by the runtime.
E.g., when you write cond ((eql nil nil) (write ""lkj""))), it is expanded to something like:
> (macroexpand '(cond ((eql nil nil) (write ""lkj""))))
(IF (EQL NIL NIL)
    (PROGN (WRITE ""lkj""))
    NIL)

and then the if form is evaluated according to its spec as the special operator.
Of course, you don't want to actually read the macroexpansion of cond to understand what it does - you read the doc. However, you do use macroexpand to debug your own macros.
Special Operators
The runtime handles special operators (such as setq), well, specially, i.e., the behavior is idiosyncratic to each special operator.
E.g., when you write (setq a (! 4)), the runtime does not evaluate a, it does, however, evaluate (! 4), it discovers that ! is fbound to a function, so it evaluates 4 (it evaluates to itself), then calls the function binding of ! with argument 4, and assigns the return value (24) to the variable a.
Order
Actually, as @Paulo mentioned in the comments, the symbol is checked for being a special operator first (because an implementation can implement a macro as a special operator and vv); it cannot be a macro and a function at the same time (but you can use compiler macros). This is out of the scope of this question though...
Practice: Use CLHS
Edit your code in Emacs, load clhs.el, and view the doc of the symbol you are interested in.
The do will say right away what the symbol is defined as.
",,"In Common Lisp, whether a function evaluates its arguments depends on the nature of the function. In general, functions do evaluate their arguments unless explicitly defined otherwise by the programmer or unless it's a special form that doesn't require evaluation of its arguments.

- `setq` is an example of a special form that does not evaluate its right-hand-side (RHS) argument. This is why you encountered an error when trying to use `(kjl klj)` because `kjl` was undefined at the time `setq` tried to assign it to `j`.

- Special forms like `cond`, `and`, and `or` are also examples of non-evaluating forms. They do evaluate their arguments as necessary to determine the outcome, but they don't necessarily force evaluation in all cases. For instance, `cond` will stop evaluating remaining clauses once a true condition is found.

","The elements in the document returned by html5-parser:parse-html5 are in the form:
(""name"" (attribute-alist) &rest children)

You could access the parts with the standard list manipulation functions, but xmls also provides functions node-name, node-attrs and node-children to access the three parts. It's a little bit clearer to use those. Edit: there are also functions xmlrep-attrib-value, to get the value of an attribute and xmlrep-tagmatch to match the tag name. The children are either plain strings, or elements in the same format.
So for example, a html document with a 2x2 table would look like this:
(defparameter *doc*
  '(""html"" ()
     (""head"" ()
       (""title"" ()
         ""Some title""))
     (""body"" ()
       (""table"" ((""class"" ""some-class""))

         (""tr"" ((""class"" ""even""))
           (""td"" () ""Third string"")
           (""td"" () ""Fourth string""))))))

In order to traverse the dom-tree, lets define a recursive depth-first search like this (note that the if-let depends on the alexandria library (either import it, or change it to alexandria:if-let)):
(defun find-tag (predicate doc &optional path)
  (when (funcall predicate doc path)
    (return-from find-tag doc))

  (when (listp doc)
    (let ((path (cons doc path)))
      (dolist (child (xmls:node-children doc))
        (if-let ((find (find-tag predicate child path)))
          (return-from find-tag find))))))

It's called with a predicate function and a document. The predicate function gets called with two arguments; the element being matched and a list of its ancestors. In order to find the first <td>, you could do this:
(find-tag (lambda (el path)
            (declare (ignore path))
            (and (listp el)
                 (xmls:xmlrep-tagmatch ""td"" el)))
          *doc*)
; => (""td"" NIL ""Some string"")

Or to find the first <td> in the even row:
(find-tag (lambda (el path)
            (and (listp el)
                 (xmls:xmlrep-tagmatch ""td"" el)
                 (string= (xmls:xmlrep-attrib-value ""class"" (first path))
                          ""even"")))
          *doc*)
; => (""td"" NIL ""Third string"")

Getting the second <td> on the even row would require something like this:
(let ((matches 0))
  (find-tag (lambda (el path)
              (when (and (listp el)
                         (xmls:xmlrep-tagmatch ""td"" el)
                         (string= (xmls:xmlrep-attrib-value ""class"" (first path))
                                  ""even""))
                (incf matches))
              (= matches 2))
            *doc*))

You could define a helper function to find the nth tag:
(defun find-nth-tag (n tag doc)
  (let ((matches 0))
    (find-tag (lambda (el path)
                (declare (ignore path))
                (when (and (listp el)
                           (xmls:xmlrep-tagmatch tag el))
                  (incf matches))
                (= matches n))
              doc)))
(find-nth-tag 2 ""td"" *doc*) ; => (""td"" NIL ""Another string"")
(find-nth-tag 4 ""td"" *doc*) ; => (""td"" NIL ""Fourth string"")

You might want to have a simple helper to get the text of a node:
(defun node-text (el)
  (if (listp el)
      (first (xmls:node-children el))
      el))

You could define similiar helpers to do whatever you need to do in your application. Using these, the example you gave would look like this:
(defparameter *doc*
  (html5-parser:parse-html5
   (drakma:http-request ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_heaviest_people"")
   :dom :xmls))

(node-text (find-nth-tag 1 ""a"" (find-nth-tag 1 ""td"" *doc*)))
; => ""Jon Brower Minnoch""

",,"To achieve your goal of extracting the first row under a specific column (in this case, 'Name') from an HTML table, you need to traverse the DOM structure more effectively. Your current approach is parsing all `td` elements and doesn't distinguish between different columns. Instead, you should look for the column header ('Name' in your example) and then find the corresponding data cell (`td`) within that row.

Here's a more general way to achieve this using Common Lisp and libraries like `cl-who`, `drakma`, and `html5-parser`:

1. Parse the HTML content.
2. Find the column header 'Name'.
3. Traverse to find the first `tr` (table row) that contains this column.

Here's a sample implementation:

```lisp
(require 'cl-ppcre)
(require 'drakma)
(require 'html5-parser)

(defun find-tag (tag doc)
  (when (listp doc)
    (when (string= (xmls:node-name doc) tag)
      (return-from find-tag doc))
    (loop for child in (xmls:node-children doc)
          for find = (find-tag tag child)
          when find do (return-from find-tag find)))
  nil)

          (xmls:nodes doc)
        (loop for row in rows
              for cells = (xmls:node-children row)
              when (and (< 0 (length cells))
                        (find header (mapcar #'xmls:node-name cells)))
              return (first cells) ; Return the first cell under this column

","Taking your question at face value, you want to print out the nodes in 'breadth-first' order, rather than using one of the standard, depth-first orderings: 'in-order' or 'pre-order' or 'post-order'.

in-order: C B D A E F
pre-order: A B C D E F
post-order: C D B F E A
requested order: A B E C D F

In your tree structure, each element can be either an atom, or a list with one element, or a list with two elements.  The first element of a list is always an atom.
What I think the pseudo-code needs to look like is approximately:
Given a list 'remains-of-tree':
    Create empty 'next-level' list
    Foreach item in `remains-of-tree`
        Print the CAR of `remains-of-tree`
        If the CDR of `remains-of-tree` is not empty
             CONS the first item onto 'next-level'
             If there is a second item, CONS that onto `next-level`
    Recurse, passing `next-level` as argument.

I'm 100% sure that can be cleaned up (that looks like trivial tail recursion, all else apart).  However, I think it works.
Start: (A (B (C D)) (E (F)))
Level 1:
Print CAR: A
Add (B (C D)) to next-level: ((B (C D)))
Add (E (F)) to next-level: ((B (C D)) (E (F)))
Pass ((B (C D) (E (F))) to level 2:
Level 2:
Item 1 is (B (C D))
Print CAR: B
Push C to next-level: (C)
Push D to next-level: (C D)
Item 2 is (E (F))
Print CAR: E
Push F to next-level: (C D F)
Pass (C D F) to level 3:

",,"Yes, you can iterate over a sequence backwards without explicitly using `reverse` or indexing.

"Many Lisp-family languages have a little bit of syntax sugar for things like addition or comparison allowing more than two operands, if optionally omitting the alternate branch etc. There would be something to be said for implementing these with macros, that would expand (+ a b c) to (+ a (+ b c)) etc; this would make the actual runtime code cleaner, simpler and slightly faster (because the logic to check for extra arguments would not have to run every time you add a pair of numbers).
However, the usual macro expansion algorithm is 'keep expanding the outermost form over and over until you get a non-macro result'. So that means e.g. + had better not be a macro that expands to +, even a reduced version, or you get an infinite loop.
Is there any existing Lisp that solves this problem at macro expansion time? If so, how does it do it?
","Common Lisp provides compiler macros.
These can be used for such optimizations. A compiler macro can conditionally decline to provide an expansion by just returning the form itself. 
",,"Some Lisps implement a feature known as 'hygienic macros' which can handle this scenario without causing infinite recursion. In these systems, the macro expansion process is designed to avoid expanding macros inside other macros that are part of the same expansion. For example, in Common Lisp, you can define a macro that processes multiple arguments by recursively expanding its own definition, but it will stop after one level of expansion when encountering non-macro forms. This ensures that `+` or similar functions do not need to be redefined as macros and avoids infinite recursion.",0.5618,[[0.23292296]],0.040521265511713804,0.31799729364005414,0.24793388429752067,0.01680672268907563,0.1322314049586777

The first promptread is indented because of the format with ~10t but not the others, which use the same exact format call.
","The problem is that after force-output and readline, the cursor is not known to formatto be at position 0. Thus absolute tabulation will fail.  If you start the format string with ~&, you will see this as an additional newline will be outputted anyway.
To solve the problem use the @ modifier to get relative tabulation:
(format *query-io* ""~10@t~a:"" prompt)

",,"The issue you're encountering is due to the `format` function's behavior. The `~10t` directive in the `format` call only affects the output of that specific line and does not persist for subsequent calls within the same function or recursive calls. Each call to `format` with `~10t` will reset the indentation for that particular line, but it won't carry over to subsequent lines or other function calls unless you explicitly set the indentation again.\n\nTo ensure consistent indentation across all prompts, you could use a different approach such as setting up a custom formatting function that maintains state.

","For the first case, the exact result of the multiply is half way between 1.0 and the largest double that is less than 1.0. Under IEEE 754 round-to-nearest rules, half way numbers are rounded to even, in this case to 1.0. In effect, the rounding of the result of the multiply undid the error introduced by rounding of the division result.
This Java program illustrates what is happening. The conversions to BigDecimal and the BigDecimal arithmetic operations are all exact:

This solution is quite similar to the one given in this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/2944197/1312456
",,"The error message you're seeing indicates that Emacs (likely through LispCabinet) detected an unsafe directory for storing server-related files. In this case, the directory `c:/Documents and Settings/Administrator/ApplicationData/.emacs.d/server` is considered unsafe because it might be outside of a typical user's writable home directory or in a system directory where writes are not allowed.

This can happen if Emacs tries to store temporary or server files in a non-standard location that isn't designed for such purposes. While this message itself does not represent an immediate security risk, it is advisable to address the issue to ensure your setup remains secure and functional.

Here are steps you can take:

1. **Move the Directory**: You can manually move the directory containing server files to a safer location within your home directory or another appropriate directory where Emacs has write permissions.
2. **Configure Emacs**: Modify your Emacs configuration to specify a different, safe directory for server files. For example, you can add something like `(server-ensure-dir ",0.5266,[[0.27521825]],0.05792966675133701,0.3032036613272311,0.21487603305785125,0.03333333333333333,0.09917355371900825

"I'm writing a function that returns elements which appear in one list and not in another. For example,
(except '(a b c) '(a d b e f))

will return '(c). The first argument can be an atom, and both are assumed to be flat. Here's my code:
(define (except lm ln)
  (cond ((null? ln) lm)
        ((not (list? lm))
         (cond ((in? lm ln) '())
               (#t lm)))

        (#t (cons (car lm) (except (cdr lm) ln)))))

Then an error returns saying ""except: misuse of unit import keyword in: (except (cdr lm) ln)"". 
Why this is happening?
","Looks like you're running into some problem with the unit library which has an except keyword defined.  But it should still be possible to use it as a name for your function, so I'm guessing that something else is wrong.  It'll be possible to say more if you provide the complete code that you're trying to run.
",,"The issue you are encountering is due to a misunderstanding of how keywords work in Scheme/Lisp. The error message suggests that somewhere in your code, you have used 'unit' (or possibly another keyword) where it doesn't belong. This typically happens when there's an unintended use of a keyword or a misplacement of a symbol.

Given the provided function `except`, let's focus on fixing and clarifying the logic:

1. The function should check if the first argument is not a list, but rather an atom.
2. If it's an atom, you need to check whether this atom is in the second list or not.

Here is a revised version of your function that addresses these points correctly:

```lisp
(define (in? elem lst)
  (cond ((null? lst) #f)
        ((eqv? elem (car lst)) #t)
        (#t (in? elem (cdr lst)))))

(define (except lm ln)
  (if (not (pair? lm))
      (if (in? lm ln) '() lm)

              ((in? (car lm) ln) (loop (cdr lm) ln))
              (#t (cons (car lm) (loop (cdr lm) ln)))))))
```

In this version:
- A helper function `in?` is defined to check if an element is in a list.
- The main function `except` first checks if the first argument is not a pair (i.e., it's an atom). If so, it uses `in?` to determine whether the atom should be included or not.
- If the first argument is a list, it recursively processes each element.

This should resolve the error and provide the correct functionality for your `except` function.",0.4856,[[0.26449185]],0.038621939617973854,0.2916277999723615,0.20754716981132076,0.0189873417721519,0.11320754716981134

It's almost certainly wrong to put DEFVAR inside a function, and likely to hurt you badly if you use DEFVAR with names like A and B. DEFVAR makes a global variable, and it makes the symbol that names it ""special""; everywhere you use it in future, you'll be getting the symbol-value instead of a lexical variable. Strange things will happen when you're not expecting it. That's why DEFVAR variables are usually named like A, etc., instead of just A. Use LET to make a normal lexical variable. And then there's not a lot of point setting it to NIL initially and then using SETQ to alter it, though you can do that if you like. Even just
(let (a b)

         b (reverse list))

If you want to load ASDF-systems, use:
(asdf:load-system 'my-system)

Some Lisp implementations (CCL for example) also allow using require for loading ASDF systems, but that functionality is implementation dependent.  If you are using Slime, and want to load a system interactively, you can do so by typing ,l my-system at the Slime REPL.
Another thing I wanted to point out is that, unlike in Python, using require or load in CL does not have anything to do with packages (think ""namespaces"").  So, if the code you are loading or requiring lives in its own package, you will either have to use its exported symbols qualified (foo:bar), or include those packages in the package your code lives in ((defpackage my-package (:use cl package-you-want-to-use ...) ...)). This does not only differ from Python imports, but also from C preprocessor #includes, the latter being mere textual inclusions.
",,"Yes, you can include code from other Lisp files using different mechanisms depending on the Lisp dialect. In Common Lisp, you can use `LOAD` or `COMPILE-FILE` to load and compile code from other files. For example, if you have a file named `other-code.lisp`, you can load it into your current session with `(load \",0.5643,[[0.32960282]],0.03969551534336223,0.14432606342951634,0.28837209302325584,0.046948356807511735,0.13023255813953488
"I am trying to write a sorting code in lisp language.
But I am not sure how to do it.
I want to use sort function of lisp using sequence.
I am trying to create sequence like this-
(setq arr (make-sequence '(vector integer) 10   :initial-element (read)))
(terpri)
(write arr)

This will set the initial element to user input. But I want to take input from the user and I have no idea how to do it. Any suggestion will be helpful.
","You can make vectors with MAKE-ARRAY. You can set its fill-pointer to 0, and then use a loop to add 10 numbers to it with VECTOR-PUSH:
(let ((vec (make-array 10 :fill-pointer 0)))
  (dotimes (i 10 vec)
    (format *query-io* ""Number ~d/10: "" (1+ i))
    (finish-output *query-io*)
    (vector-push (parse-integer (read-line *query-io*)) vec)))

You could also achieve the same like this:
(make-array 10 :initial-contents
            (loop
               for i from 1 to 10
               do (format *query-io* ""Number ~d/10: "" i)
               do (finish-output *query-io*)
               collecting (parse-integer (read-line *query-io*))))

But that creates a temporary list for the input.
Also, as Svante suggested, you can use MAP-INTO:
;; If you don't want the number in the prompt, you can remove the LET
(let ((i 0))
  (map-into (make-array 10)
            (lambda () 
              (format *query-io* ""Number ~d/10: "" (incf i))
              (finish-output *query-io*)
              (parse-integer (read-line *query-io*)))))

",,"To achieve your goal of taking input from the user to initialize a sequence with `make-sequence`, you can modify your code as follows:

```lisp

    (setq arr (make-sequence '(vector integer) n :initial-element (read))) ; Create the vector with user input element
    arr))

(create-vector)
(terpri)
(write arr)
```

This code defines a function `create-vector` that first reads an integer to determine the size of the vector. Then, it uses this size and another read value as the initial element for the vector. The function returns the created vector.

After defining the function, you can call `(create-vector)` which will prompt the user for input and then display the resulting vector.",0.601,[[0.23511598]],0.10247926228985293,0.2279205851459719,0.29861111111111116,0.04195804195804196,0.14583333333333334

","PUSHNEW is the modifying version of ADJOIN. You need to use the proper :TEST argument for comparing the kind of elements the list contains (such as #'EQUAL for lists).

",,"In Lisp, if you want to perform an in-place adjoin of lists, you can use the `push` function. However, `push` will modify the list by prepending the item to it. If you want to append elements conditionally without duplicating them, you might need to write a custom function or use a combination of functions like `member`, `copy-list`, and `nconc`. Here’s an example of how you can achieve this:

```lisp
(defun in-place-adjoin (element list)
  (let ((lst (copy-list list))) ; Create a copy to avoid modifying the original list
    (if (not (member element lst :test #'equal))

(in-place-adjoin '((1)) '((1) (1 2) (1 2 3)))
(in-place-adjoin '(1) '((1) (1 2) (1 2 3)))
```

This function creates a copy of the list, checks if the element is already present using `member` with `equal` as the test to ensure deep equality for lists, and then adds it in place. If you are working on mutable data structures or specific contexts where in-place modification is required, you might need to adapt this approach accordingly.",0.6212,[[0.30611276]],0.26436629199023465,0.4381368679620225,0.32894736842105265,0.1390728476821192,0.21052631578947367

","CCL has multithreading, I believe. You could try spawning a worker thread in the background and have a control thread doing a blocking read, and then communicating via a special variable.  The following works in Lispworks, I don't have CCL available.  You'd have to translate the mp:process-run-function to whatever CCL uses to spawn threads:
(defparameter *f* nil)
(defun cmd-loop ()

"I'm trying to implement the Towers of Hanoi.I'm not printing out anything between my recursive calls yet, but I keep getting an error saying 

'('(LIST) 'NIL 'NIL) should be a lambda expression

I've read that the reason this happens is because of a problem with the parenthesis, however I cannot seem to find what my problem is. I think it's happening in the pass-list function when I am trying to call the hanoi function.  My code:
(defun pass-list(list)
   (hanoi('('(list)'()'())))
)

(defun hanoi ('('(1) '(2) '(3)))

    (hanoi '('(cdr 1) '(cons(car 1) 2) '(3)))

    (hanoi '('(cons(car 3)1) '(2)'(cdr 3)))
 )

","This code has many syntax problems;  there are erroneous quotes all over the place, and it looks like you're trying to use numbers as variables, which will not work.  The source of the particular error message that you mentioned comes from 
(hanoi('('(list)'()'())))

First, understand that the quotes in  'x and '(a b c) are shorthand for the forms (quote x) and (quote (a b c)), and that (quote anything) is the syntax for getting anything, without anything being evaluated.  So '(1 2 3) gives you the list (1 2 3), and '1 gives you 1. quote is just a symbol though, and can be present in other lists, so '('(list)'()'()) is the same as (quote ((quote (list)) (quote ()) (quote ()))) which evaluates to the list ((quote (list)) (quote ()) (quote ())).  Since () can also be written nil (or NIL), this last is the same as ('(list) 'NIL 'NIL).  In Common Lisp, function calls look like
(function arg1 arg2 ...)

where each argi is a form, and function is either a symbol (e.g., list, hanoi, car) or a list, in which case it must be a lambda expression, e.g., (lambda (x) (+ x x)).  So, in your line
(hanoi('('(list)'()'())))

we have a function call.  function is hanoi, and arg1 is ('('(list)'()'())).  But how will this arg1 be evaluated?  Well, it's a list, which means it's a function application.  What's the function part?  It's 
'('(list)'()'())

which is the same as 
'('(list 'NIL 'NIL))

But as  I just said, the only kind of list that can be function is a lambda expression.  This clearly isn't a lambda expression, so you get the error that you're seeing.  
I can't be sure, but it looks like you were aiming for something like the following.  The line marked with ** is sort of problematic, because you're calling hanoi with some arguments, and when it returns (if it ever returns;  it seems to me like you'd recurse forever in this case), you don't do anything with the result.  It's ignored, and then you go onto the third line.
(defun pass-list(list)
  (hanoi (list list) '() '()))

(defun hanoi (a b c)
  (hanoi (rest a) (cons (first a) b) c)  ; **
  (hanoi (cons (first c) a) b (rest c)))

If hanoi is supposed to take a single list as an argument, and that list is supposed to contain three lists (I'm not sure why you'd do it that way instead of having hanoi take just three arguments, but that's a different question, I suppose), it's easy enough to modify;  just take an argument abc and extract the first, second, and third lists from it, and pass a single list to hanoi on the recursive call:
(defun hanoi (abc)
  (let ((a (first abc))
        (b (second abc))
        (c (third abc)))
    (hanoi (list (rest a) (cons (first a) b) c))
    (hanoi (list (cons (first c) a) b (rest c)))))

I'd actually probably use destructuring-bind here to simplify getting a, b, and c out of abc:
(defun hanoi (abc)
  (destructuring-bind (a b c) abc
    (hanoi (list (rest a) (cons (first a) b) c))
    (hanoi (list (cons (first c) a) b (rest c)))))

",,"The issue you are encountering is due to the incorrect use of quote (`'`) and list syntax. In Lisp, `'` is used for quoting a symbol or form, not for constructing lists in the way you have attempted. Additionally, there are some syntactical errors and logical issues in your code. Here’s a corrected version of your Towers of Hanoi implementation:

```lisp

","Use read
The simplest option is to ask the user to enter the list (with the parens) and just call (read).
The second option is to put the parens yourself:
(read-from-string (concatenate 'string ""("" (read-line) "")""))

safety and security
Note that the power of the Lisp reader can put you in trouble. E.g., if the user types #.(start-ww3) instead of (1 2 3) at your prompt, you might not reach your bomb shelter in time.
This means that you must bind *read-eval* to nil when calling read on text you do not control.
Call parse-integer repeatedly
Finally, you can call parse-integer in a loop
(defun parse-integers (s &optional (start 0))
  (loop with num do 
    (setf (values num start) (parse-integer s :start start :junk-allowed t))
    while num collect num))

"In some implementations of Common LISP we can say that for the following expression
(eq 'a 'a)

Is true because 'a and 'a are the ""same atom"". 
This may be implementation dependent, but it seems the phrase (used in a popular LISP teaching book) assumes that atoms of the same value are stored in the same location in memory. 
In Java, two interned strings of the same value are stored in the same location in memory. 
Now Clojure on the JVM inherits Java's legacy, but is it true to say that two atoms in Clojure (on JVM) having the same value are the same atom? (ie how does Clojure's atom storage mechanism work?)
","First, ""atom"" has a different meaning in Clojure than in most other Lisps. See http://clojure.org/atoms
Clojure's = function uses value-based equality. So two objects with equal values will be = even if they are stored in different locations in memory.
To test if two objects are actually the same object, at the same address in memory, use the identical? function.
",,"In Clojure running on the JVM, two atoms with the same value are not necessarily stored at the same location in memory. Unlike Java's `intern` mechanism which ensures that interned strings are stored once and reused, Clojure does not automatically interning for all symbols or values. However, Clojure does have an interning mechanism for keywords (which start with a colon, e.g., :keyword) where they are guaranteed to be unique across the JVM. For other atoms like symbols ('a), numbers, strings, etc., while they may often refer to the same object due to interning optimizations in the JVM and Clojure's implementation, it is not guaranteed by the language specification. The `eq?` function can return true for these cases, indicating that both references point to the same object, but this behavior can vary based on runtime conditions.",0.5709,[[0.3738784]],0.13098288119051762,0.3681259069220445,0.32835820895522383,0.10050251256281406,0.1691542288557214
"Recently, I was reading article ""Root Of Lisp"" from Paul Graham.I encountered some questions.From the book, it defines expression as two :1.atom;2.list, while list is consisted of zero or many expressions.Then it sayes that a list can be evaluated.Now I hava some problems:

Can every list be evaluated?Is every list an expression?
If a list can be evaluated, then it may have its first element  as an operator,so an operator is an expression?Is operator atomic or another?
The operator car returns the first element of a list, if the list can be evaluated, then what will it return , the operator?Can you give me some sample of this to show how to use the returned value?
The operator cdr returns elements besides the first element as a list,then this returned list can't be evaluated?

I am a freshman for Lisp,I don't know whether I hava explained my problems clearly.
","A Lisp S-expression (sexp) is either an atom, or a list of sexps.
1
All Lisp forms (that is, things that can be evaluated) are sexps, but not all sexps are Lisp forms.
More specifically, a Lisp form is any atom, or a list whose first element is a symbol.
(foo 42)       ; valid Lisp form
(undefined 42) ; Lisp form, but invalid because of undefined function
(42 foo)       ; not a Lisp form - numbers aren't symbols

2
As I just mentioned, the ""operator"" (first element) of a list-that-is-a-Lisp-form must be a symbol. (A Lisp-1 (e.g. Scheme) allows any Lisp form in the operator position, but Roots of Lisp is discussing the original (a Lisp-2), and Common Lisp (a Lisp-2); they restrict the operator position to symbols.)
3
Lisp code, before compilation, is Lisp data. That is important.
If I said (car 'foo), the program would complain; and rightly so, because foo isn't a list.
If I said (car '(car 'foo)), the inner list is not evaluated (good old quote syntax '), and car extracts the thing in the operator position - in this case, the symbol car. This can be useful when defining macros.
4
Depends.
First, imagine I have foo defined as a function of two arguments, and bar defined as both a variable and a function of one argument. Also remember that, under the hood, your Lisp is probably calling eval on whatever you type in.
Now (eval '(foo bar 42)) is valid, and will invoke foo with arguments <the value of bar> and 42. (eval (cdr '(foo bar 42))) is also perfectly valid; it is equivalent to (eval '(bar 42)), which invokes bar with the argument 42.
If bar were not defined as a function, the cdr of the second example would still produce a valid Lisp form, but it would be an error to evaluate that form, as (bar 42) invokes the function bar (there isn't one).
It is useful to talk about syntax and semantics. Syntactically, any atom, or any list with a symbol in operator position, is valid. Semantically (inside the bounds of the syntax), any atom that is a symbol with no variable definition is an error; so is any list whose first element is a symbol with no function definition.
I hope this answer helps you out.
",,"Your questions are quite clear and touch on fundamental concepts of Lisp. Let's address them one by one:

1. **Can every list be evaluated? Is every list an expression?**
   - In Lisp, a *list* is indeed a type of *expression*. Lists can contain other expressions as elements. However, not all lists are necessarily meant to be evaluated directly. For example, you could have a list that is just data and not intended for evaluation.

2. **If a list can be evaluated, then it may have its first element as an operator, so an operator is an expression? Is the operator atomic or another?**
   - Yes, in Lisp, if a list represents a form to be evaluated (like `(+ 1 2)`), the first element of that list (`+` in this case) is known as an *operator*. An operator is itself an expression. In terms of atomicity, operators can be either atoms or more complex expressions themselves. For instance, `+` is a symbol, which is an atom.

3. **The operator `car` returns the first element of a list, if the list can be evaluated, then what will it return? The operator?**
   - If you evaluate a list like `(+ 1 2)`, the evaluation process starts by applying the function in the first position (the operator). In this case, `+` is applied to its arguments `(1 2)`. The result of evaluating the entire form would be `3`. However, if you use `car` on the unevaluated list, it simply returns the first element, which is an atom (`+`) in this case. For example:
     ```lisp
     (car '(+ 1 2)) ; Returns: +
     ```

4. **The operator `cdr` returns elements besides the first element as a list, then this returned list can't be evaluated?**
   - The `cdr` function does indeed return all but the first element of a list as another list. This resulting sublist itself is still an expression and can potentially be evaluated if it represents one. For example:
     ```lisp
     (cdr '(+ 1 2)) ; Returns: (1 2)
     ```

To illustrate these concepts, here are some sample code snippets:

```lisp
;; Define a function to evaluate an expression
(defun evaluate-expression (expr)
  (if (null expr) nil
      (let ((fn (car expr)))
        (apply fn (cdr expr)))))

;; Evaluate (+ 1 2)
(evaluate-expression '(+ 1 2)) ; Returns: 3

;; Use car and cdr on an unevaluated list
(car '(+ 1 2)) ; Returns: +
(cdr '(+ 1 2)) ; Returns: (1 2)

;; Define a more complex expression
(defparameter *expr* '(* (+ 1 2) (- 3 4)))

;; Evaluate the complex expression
(evaluate-expression *expr*) ; Returns: -5

```

These examples should help clarify how lists, operators, and expressions work in Lisp.",0.5904,[[0.54296501]],0.21308744963730952,0.3758596898331815,0.44554455445544555,0.09429280397022334,0.18564356435643564
"In Lisp (I am still learning Lisp with SBCL), local variables are declared with let, and the scope is only within that expression.  Why is that?  Unlike in other imperative languages like C/C++/Java..., where we can freely use local variables anywhere in its function scope.
","Just another little insight into what let is. It is basically an application of an anonymous function ""spelled backwards"".
I will use JavaScript for the illustration because it is more C-like language and it illustrates the concept quite well.
(function(variableA, variableB){
  console.log(""variableA = "" + variableA);
  console.log(""variableA * variableB = "" + variableA * variableB);})(6, 7);

Now, let's name the parts: from function to ;} is the function definition. (definition)(arguments) is the application. Let expression does essentially the same thing, i.e. it invokes an anonymous function with arguments, which you use inside that function as variables. So, if you consider the previous example, rewriting it in let form would make something like:
(let(variableA = 6, variableB = 7){
  console.log(""variableA = "" + variableA);
  console.log(""variableA * variableB = "" + variableA * variableB);});

(JavaScript doens't support let, yet, so above isn't a working code example, but it should be an illustration)
You should also note that it is not exactly that simple. Because in more complex cases you  may want to reference one of the arguments when constructing another - and then you would use (let* ...), or you would want to use functions as arguments of this expression, and then you would use (flet ...) or (labels ...). But the general idea is the same.
",,"In Lisp, local variables are declared with `let` because the language is designed around a different philosophy compared to imperative languages like C/C++/Java. In Lisp, everything that you can reference (functions, macros, variables) must be explicitly defined. This includes local variables. By declaring local variables within a `let` form, it ensures that these bindings are clearly scoped and limited to the specific part of the code where they are needed. This approach promotes immutability and makes the code more predictable and easier to reason about. Unlike in C/C++/Java, where you can declare local variables anywhere within a function's scope, Lisp enforces this at the `let` form level to maintain its functional programming paradigm.",0.4899,[[0.27705774]],0.04387622760200026,0.16907740422204845,0.25688073394495414,0.01230769230769231,0.1162079510703364

","This is a common problem with dynamically-scoped values in many languages (not just Racket). Here's what happens when you evaluate the code:

The location parameter is defined with value ""here""
Enter the let...
Enter parameterize...
The parameter location is dynamically updated with the value ""with a fox""
The lambda expression is evaluated to create a closure which closes over location
Return from parameterized block—parameter location reverts to its original value of ""here""
The resulting lambda is bound to get
Evaluate let body...
You call (get), and it looks up the current value of location, which is ""here"", and that's the result.

If you carefully read the documentation on parameters it explains that the parameter always takes the value of the closest update in the stack. Since your update with the value ""with a fox"" gets popped off the stack before going into the let body, it's no longer visible when you make the actual call to get. A simple fix is to copy the value from the parameter and let the closure close over the copy:
(define location (make-parameter ""here""))

(let ([get (parameterize ([location ""with a fox""])
             (let ([loc (location)])
                (lambda () loc)))])
  (get))

Now the lambda closes over loc, which should have the expected value.

"A form in Lisp/Scheme/Racket has symbol put at first position. This code works in Racket:

","Let me offer an alternative solution via overriding the application syntax #%app. Here's an example of the ternary operator in C-like languages:

"I am a Common Lisp newbie who's beginning to learn the language. My question is: I've seen several functions use the predicate syntax in different ways. For example (just looked this up), there is streamp and pathnamep, but there is also input-stream-p and output-stream-p. Why aren't all functions standardized to use *p or *-p? Is this maybe just a historical artifact?
","The rule is that one-word predicate names end in just P, while multi-word predicate names end in -P.  The reason for the former is mostly historical; the reason for the latter is that a name like input-streamp would wrongly suggest that the question being asked is “is this input a stream?” or something like that.
",,"The use of different predicate suffixes like -p, p, and other variations is indeed a mix of historical practices and design choices. In Common Lisp, predicates are functions that return a boolean value (T or NIL) based on the evaluation of their argument(s). The specific choice of suffix often comes down to conventions established in various parts of the language or in different libraries.\n\nFor example, `streamp` and `pathnamep` follow a more general pattern where the 'p' is added as a postfix. On the other hand, `input-stream-p` and `output-stream-p` use a hyphen before the 'p', which might be used to indicate that it's checking for a specific type of stream (input or output).\n\nThis variability can often be attributed to different authors or maintainers of various parts of Common Lisp. It is not strictly standardized, but rather a convention that has evolved over time. However, the goal remains consistent: to provide clear and unambiguous boolean values indicating some property of an object.\n\nWhile there isn't a strict requirement for all predicates to use *p or *-p, it's generally advisable to follow these conventions when writing your own predicates to ensure consistency with other parts of the language.",0.547,[[0.28681502]],0.03325107086982622,0.3037974683544304,0.22556390977443608,0.0,0.12781954887218047

(defun filter-list-into-two-parts (predicate list)
  (list (remove-if-not predicate list) (remove-if predicate list)))

but I would like to know if there is a built-in function in Lisp that can do this, or perhaps a better way of writing this function?
","I don't think there is a built-in and your version is sub-optimal because it traverses the list twice and calls the predicate on each list element twice.

I return two values instead of the list thereof; this is more idiomatic (you will be using multiple-value-bind to extract yes and no from the multiple values returned, instead of using destructuring-bind to parse the list, it conses less and is faster, see also values function in Common Lisp).
A more general version would be
(defun split-list (key list &key (test 'eql))

Your ""lambda expression message"" is due to an extra set of parens around equal in the listp clause. Remember, Lisp parentheses are meaningful.
Use the standard library!
ANSI Common Lisp has subst which does what you want:
(subst '(99 99) 1 '(3 1 2 (6 1) 7 (5 (5 (3 1))) 9) :test #'equal)
==> (3 (99 99) 2 (6 (99 99)) 7 (5 (5 (3 (99 99)))) 9)

Your algorithm
Since you are operating on the tree, not list (you say ""all the
main list levels""), you should treat car and cdr identically:
(defun my-subst (new old tree &key (test #'eql))
  (cond ((funcall test old tree)

(my-subst '(99 99) 1 '(3 1 2 (6 1) 7 (5 (5 (3 1))) 9) :test #'equal)
==> (3 (99 99) 2 (6 (99 99)) 7 (5 (5 (3 (99 99)))) 9)

Or, simplified (without &key and
funcall):
(defun my-subst (new old tree)

"How do LISPs or MLs implement tail-call optimization?
","I can't speak on the exact implementation details different compilers/interpreters, however generally speaking tail-call optimization operates like this:
Normally a function call involves something like this:

Allocate stack space for the return
Push your current instruction pointer onto the stack
Allocate stack space for the function parameters and set them appropriately
Call your function
To return it sets it's return space appropriately, pops off the instruction pointer it should be returning to and jumps to it

However when a function is in tail position, which pretty much means you are returning the result of the function you are about to call, you can be tricky and do

Re-use the stack space allocated for your own return value as the stack space allocated for the return value of the function you are about to call
Re-use the instruction pointer you should be returning to as the instruction pointer that the function you are about to call will use
Free your own parameters stack space
Allocate space for the parameters and set appropriately
Set the value of your parameters
Call your function
When it returns, it will be returning directly to your caller.

Note that #1 and #2 don't actually involve any work, #3 can be tricky or simple depending on your implementation, and 4-7 don't involve anything special from the function you are calling. Also note that all of this results in a 0 stack growth with respect to your call stack, so this allows for infinte recursion and generally speeding things up a little.
Also note that this kind of optimization can be applied not only to directly recursive functions, but co-recursive functions and in fact all calls that are in tail position.
",,"Lisp implementations can and often do support tail-call optimization (TCO) to enable efficient recursion. Tail call is a specific form of function call where the recursive call is the last operation in the function, meaning that no further computation is required after the call. If the compiler or interpreter supports TCO, it can replace the current stack frame with the new one for the recursive call, effectively turning the recursion into iteration and preventing stack overflow.\n\nMost modern Lisp implementations, such as those of Common Lisp (e.g., SBCL, CLISP), Clojure, and Racket, implement TCO. However, the exact mechanisms can vary between different dialects and implementations. For instance, in Scheme, while some implementations do not guarantee TCO due to historical reasons and backward compatibility concerns, others like Chez Scheme and Guile do support it.\n\nTo take advantage of TCO in your Lisp programs, you should structure your recursive functions so that the call is in a tail position, typically after any other operations have been performed. This allows the compiler or interpreter to optimize the recursion for efficiency.",0.5333,[[0.50289036]],0.14685317816001636,0.2465449581982597,0.36708860759493667,0.05508474576271186,0.16455696202531647

"I'm currently learning Scheme (using Racket), but one of the challenges I'm coming upon is trying to execute the following bit of code, which is meant to execute Racket code from user input using eval:
(display (eval (read)))

 
Here's some of the weird behavior I've observed so far:

(display (eval (read))) in the definition window prompts for keyboard input, as expected, when the definitions are run. However, providing the input
((lambda (x) (+ x 1)) 1)
 
gives the error
?: function application is not allowed;
no #%app syntax transformer is bound in: ((lambda (x) (+ x 1)) 1)
On the other hand, using (display ((eval (read)) 1)) and providing input
(lambda (x) (+ x 1))
 
returns the error
lambda: unbound identifier;
also, no #%app syntax transformer is bound in: lambda
However, running (display (eval (read))) and providing ((lambda (x) (+ x 1)) 1) in the console pane, as opposed to the definitions pane, prints out 2, as expected.

What is the reason for this behavior?
","It looks like you don't have the namespace set up. If you're running (eval (read)) within a file, it doesn't work because the current-namespace is set to an empty namespace by default. You can set up a namespace with racket/base in it by doing (current-namespace (make-base-namespace)) first:
#lang racket
(current-namespace (make-base-namespace))
(println (eval (read)))

Running this program and giving it the input ((lambda (x) (+ x 1)) 1) results in it printing 2.
The reason it worked in the interactions window (item 3 of your weird-behavior list), is that in the interactions window, the current-namespace parameter is set to the namespace of the file. 
This is not true for the definitions window, the main program, so you have to set the current-namespace yourself, or pass a namespace in as a second argument to eval:
#lang racket
(define ns (make-base-namespace))
(println (eval (read) ns))

",,"The observed behavior is due to differences in how Racket handles syntax transformers and evaluation contexts between the definition window and the console pane. In the definition window, when you use (display (eval (read))), it's evaluated in a context where #%app syntax transformer is not active by default for function applications directly, leading to the error message 'function application is not allowed'. However, when you wrap the input with an additional layer of evaluation as in (display ((eval (read)) 1)), the inner eval evaluates the lambda form into a procedure before it's passed to display, which then applies the procedure correctly. In contrast, the console pane provides a more permissive environment where such direct function applications are allowed without needing explicit transformation. Therefore, the input provided directly in the definition window needs to be adjusted by an additional layer of eval or evaluation context to work as expected.",0.567,[[0.39785915]],0.22310398933851472,0.32934537055077384,0.3896103896103897,0.06535947712418301,0.16883116883116883

It applies each function in the list to `x` and `y` and collects the results. The example usage demonstrates how you can use these functions together.\n\nThe output for the given example will be `(8 4 8 3 12 8)` as expected.",0.606,[[0.37998921]],0.10212650096071113,0.21409847510382798,0.37499999999999994,0.11111111111111112,0.21634615384615385

","There is a simple way for this:
(defun rotate (list-of-lists)
  (apply #'mapcar #'list list-of-lists))

Your attempt is always returning the original mat.  Fix your indentation, and you see that the returned value from the if form is always thrown away.
Edit:  How this works:

List takes any number of arguments and makes a list of it.  Its function definition can be imagined about like this:
(defun list (&rest arguments)
  arguments) ; exploit the automatic &rest construction

Mapcar takes a function and any number of lists, and then makes a
new list of the values created by calling the function always with
one element from those lists.  Example: (mapcar #'foo '((A B) (C
D))) will construct a new list, where the first element is the
result of (foo 'A 'C) and the second the result of (foo 'B 'D).
Apply takes a spreadable argument list designator as its last
argument.  This means that if you give it a list as its last
argument, that list can be ""spread"" to produce individual arguments
for the function.  Example: (apply #'+ '(1 2 3)) has the same
effect as (+ 1 2 3).

Now you can expand the line:
(apply #'mapcar #'list '((A B) (C D)))

=>
(mapcar #'list '(A B) '(C D))

=>
(list (list 'A 'C) (list 'B 'D))

=>

",,"The issue with your function is that it's not correctly transposing the matrix.

Instead, you should create a list of the second elements from each row, then the third, and so on, until you've cycled through all columns. To achieve this, you can use nested `mapcar` calls or a loop to collect the transposed elements correctly.

"How come most Lisps and Schemes are dynamically typed?
Does static typing not mix with some of their common features?
","Typing and s-expressions can be made to work together, see typed scheme.
Partly it is a historical coincidence that s-expression languages are dynamically typed. These languages tend to rely more heavily on macros, and the ease of parsing and pattern-matching on s-expressions makes macro processing much easier. Most research on sophisticated macros happens in s-expression languages.
Typed Hygienic Macros are hard.
",,"Most implementations of Lisp and Scheme are indeed dynamically typed because these languages were designed with flexibility and rapid prototyping in mind. Dynamic typing aligns well with their use cases, especially in interactive development environments where developers often need to experiment quickly.

Static typing, on the other hand, requires type annotations or inference which can sometimes conflict with Lisp's and Scheme’s expressive power and simplicity. These languages often include features like macros and first-class functions that allow for powerful abstractions and code generation, which can be more naturally expressed in a dynamically typed setting.

However, it is possible to add static typing to some Lisp dialects through various tools and libraries. For example, Cling (C with Lisp) or CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) with additional type checking mechanisms have been extended to support static typing. Nonetheless, the core design of most Lisps remains dynamically typed due to the historical context and the intended use cases for these languages.",0.5425,[[0.350074]],0.1073165041787107,0.3391959798994975,0.2995594713656388,0.062222222222222213,0.14096916299559473

"Just very curious about this, from my own experience , all the graphic programming seems to C or C++ related. Like the Direct10X. Does functional programming language provide some sort of graphic library to develop video game?
","You can use functional languages to do graphics/game programming just as in any other language.
It's only a simple game, but I wrote Ironclad: Steam Legions in Clojure as an exercise in functional programming for game development.
Here are some lessons I learnt / general observations on using Clojure for game programming:

You need to be careful about performance as games can be very demanding and functional languages do impose some overheads. Clojure is certainly ""good enough"" for most games, but you need to know the tricks to keep your code optimised. For example, functional languages can get a bit GC-heavy producing a lot of temporary objects. You need to learn the tricks to avoid this (for example, using reduce in a way that avoids creating new sequence objects, or leveraging primitive artithmetic)
Mutability is useful in games. For example, if you are doing anything with physics or smooth animation you often have a lot of objects with constantly changing locations. You can simulate this with functional/immutable data structures but if you care about performance it's not a good idea. Hence it's worth finding out how to get mutable data in your functional language even if it isn't idiomatic (e.g. in Clojure you will probably want to make use of Java arrays)
Immutable persistent data structures actually turn out to be very useful in games as well. In Ironclad, the entire game state was stored in a single immutable data structure. This allowed for some cool tricks like efficiently snapshotting the game state / instant undos / running backwards in time.
Clojure is awesome for game scripting. The dynamic nature coupled with runtime compilation and the ability to define arbitrary DSLs with macros is a massive win. In fact, even if I was writing a game in an OOP language like Java I would seriously consider using Clojure (or another Lisp) for scripting.
Clojure is awesome for interactive development. I often found myself running the game in one window while hacking the running code in a REPL alongside. It's fun to alter game data structures and immediately see the effects! This awesome video also gives you a taste of what's possible with Clojure-style development.
In Clojure at least you will often want to use the Java libraries for graphics, e.g. Swing for 2D or LWJGL for 3D. In some cases wrappers for these already exist, however I found it easy enough to use them directly from Clojure. After all, Java interop is as simple as (.methodName object arg1 arg2)

In conclusion, I think functional languages are perfectly good choices for game development, with the exception of very performance-intensive games where you are still likely to be better with C/C++ in order to have more direct control over the hardware.
",,"While it is true that C and C++ are commonly used for graphics programming due to their performance and control over system resources, functional programming languages do indeed provide libraries to develop video games. Languages like Scheme, Erlang, and Haskell have game development frameworks available. For example, there is a functional approach game development library called LÖVE which is written in Lua but can be used with other languages as well. Additionally, F# has FShade for shader programming, and Elm has support for web-based graphics through its ecosystem. So while C and C++ might dominate traditional graphics programming due to their performance characteristics, functional programming languages offer viable alternatives.",0.5547,[[0.34736651]],0.011864589318384256,0.09938090583251875,0.19965576592082618,0.04145077720207254,0.11015490533562823
"I'm trying to write a function that takes a list and returns true if it contains a duplicate entry and false otherwise. I know I'm supposed to use member.  Here is my attempt so far (which fails):
(defun dupl (lst)
  (if (null lst) '())
  (if ((member (car lst) (cdr lst)) (cons (car lst) (dupes (cdr lst))))
    (t (dupl (cdr lst)))))

","Just my two cents on efficiency. If you use memberp to test for duplicates, then you're comparing each element to each other element and the complexity is O(N^2). Joshua in his answer suggested using a hash table to test for duplicates, which will give a linear running time O(N) at the expense of space. It might also be slower for smaller lists. Finally, if your list can be sorted, then you should get O(N.log(N)) as coredump- mentions. Here is an example that tests for duplicates in numeric lists using sort. (This is a destructive function.)
(defun duplicatesp (list)
  (mapl (lambda (cdr) (if (eql (first cdr) (second cdr))
                          (return-from duplicatesp T)))
   (sort list '<)) nil)

UPDATE
Out of curiosity, I measured the performance of the suggested answers for worst-case scenarios (almost no duplicates). So, 1 mln tries of lists of 10 elements:

using member (Jan's answer): 1.139 seconds;
using hash-table (Joshua's answer): 1.436 seconds;
using sort (see above, but with first copying the list): 1.484 seconds.

So, no difference with small lists. Interestingly, using a hash table has some penalty but it is very small. Let's try 1000 tries of lists of 1000 elements:

using member: 9.968 seconds;
using hash-table: 0.234 seconds;
using sort: 0.390 seconds.

As expected, using member has higher complexity. The difference between sorting and hashing is non-visible at this list size. Let's do 10 tries of lists of 1,000,000 elements:

using hash-table: 3.214 seconds;
using sort: 9.296 seconds.

So, sort is still quite good but is slowing down. Here is a simple code I used to profile the functions:
(defun random-list (length)
  (loop for i from 0 below length collecting
       (random (expt 10 10))))

(defun random-collection (length tries)
  (loop for i from 0 below tries collecting
       (random-list length)))

(defun test-duplicates (function &key length tries)
  (let ((rc (random-collection length tries)))

"Currently learning Common Lisp with SBCL, and it's bugging me how query-io has some unexpected differences from standard input and output. I will assume that standard-output contains a newline, or is formatted with one, because
(format *query-io* ""hello"")
Contains no newline at all.
Now, using read-line gives me this behavior
(defun read (prompt)
  (format *query-io* ""~a: "" prompt)
  (read-line))

(read ""message"")
> hello
""hello""
message: NIL

I was told this is expected, as SBCL would wait for a newline to be inputted before printing the format, but what I don't get is the result of changing the second line
(defun read (prompt)
  (format *standard-output* ""~a: "" prompt)
  (read-line))

(read ""message"")
> hello
message: 
""hello""
NIL

Why is the order different? I don't think the newline after the prompt variable affects the result
","If you want things to behave in a predictable way you should write programs which ensure that:

don't name the function read (in fact I'm extremely convinced that SBCL wouldn't have allowed you to name the function read, unless perhaps you are using a prehistoric version);
be clear about what streams you are actually reading and writing to;
if you want output to appear at a given time, say you do.

So in your first function you are doing something equivalent to what I assume is this:
(defun f1 (prompt)
  (format *query-io* ""~a: "" prompt)
  (read-line))

This:

writes the prompt to *query-io*, which means that at some future time it may appear on whatever *query-io* points at;
reads a line from *standard-input*;
returns the result of reading that line.

So if you call this function it will read a line from *standard-input* which perhaps is the terminal but may not be.  At some time after the call to format some output probably will appear on *query-io* which may also point at the terminal.  There is no guarantee as to when or in fact even if that output will appear: for instance if you modify the function to be:
(defun f1.1 (prompt)
  (format *query-io* ""~a: "" prompt)
  (clear-output *query-io*)
  (read-line))

it is quite possible that the prompt will never appear.
When output actually appears from functions which write to streams if you don't explicitly say 'write it now' depends on many, many factors:

what the stream points to;
if there's a buffer;
how big the buffer is;
how full the buffer is;
whether you later called clear-output on the stream and whether clear-output actually does anything;
whether you later closed the stream with :abort t and whether that actually does anything;
the price of chocolate on the moons of Jupiter.

In your second function things are mostly the same:
(defun f2 (prompt)
  (format *standard-output* ""~a: "" prompt)
  (read-line))

This time format is writing to *standard-output*, not *query-io* and again you are reading a line from *standard-input*.  And again, when and if the output from format appears is in the lap of the gods.
So what you need to do is

be clear about what streams you are using;
actually ask for output to appear when you want it, not later.

In particular never make assumptions that output written to some stream appears at any given point 'on its own' or 'after a newline', or anything like that.
If you want to prompt and read from *query-io* you do it like this:
(defun f3 (prompt)
  (format *query-io* ""~a: "" prompt)
  (finish-output *query-io*)
  (read-line *query-io*))

If you want to prompt on *standard-output* and read from *standard-input* then:
(defun f4 (prompt)
  (format *standard-output* ""~a: "" prompt)

"In church numerals, if we have:
# (define zero (lambda (f) (lambda (x) x)))
zero = lambda f: lambda x: x

Then the successor function can be defined as:
# (define succ (lambda (n) (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((n f) x))))))
succ = lambda n: lambda f: lambda x: f(n(f)(x))

Maybe this is a silly question, but if the successor essentially adds one more wrapper f(...) to the previous equation, why couldn't this just be defined as f(n)? Is this more for consistency of definition, or why can't that shorter form be used?
(Note: using python definitions here as well as scheme as it makes it a bit simpler for me to test with.)
","The numeral n is defined as n applications of the function f to some argument x.
Thus,
0 = λf.λx.x
1 = λf.λx.f x
2 = λf.λx.f (f x)
3 = λf.λx.f (f (f (x))
...

Note that 1 is not the same as λf.λx.f 0, so succ 0 can't be, either. (The same is true for the other numerals.)
Your definition, λn.λf.λx.(f n) would give
succ 0 = (λn.λf.λx.(f n)) (λg.λy.y)
       = λf.λx.f (λg.λy.y)

which is not the same as 1, but
 (λn.λf.λx.f (n f x)) (λg.λy.y)
= λf.λx.f ((λg.λy.y) f x)
= λf.λx.f ((λy.y) x)
= λf.λx.f x
= 1

",,"In Church numerals, `n` represents a number through its behavior of applying a function `f`, which is passed into it and then applied to an initial value `x`. The `succ` (successor) function generates the next numeral by wrapping one more layer of function application around the previous numeral. While it might seem that simply returning `f(n)` could suffice, doing so would not correctly capture the essence of what a Church numeral is: a higher-order function that applies a given function repeatedly.

Using `f(n(f)(x))` ensures that the new numeral effectively represents an additional application of the function `f`. This definition is crucial for maintaining the correct behavior when performing arithmetic operations. For example, adding two numbers using their Church numerals involves composing these functions, and this structure allows us to do so correctly.

Therefore, defining `succ` as just `f(n)` would not preserve the intended meaning or functionality of Church numerals. The additional layer of function application is necessary for maintaining consistency in how operations like addition and multiplication are performed.",0.528,[[0.17377472]],0.08803447090895253,0.24130418186084326,0.264026402640264,0.07973421926910298,0.16501650165016502
"I've a beginner (if that) to lisp/scheme and come across the following two ways to ""create a function"" in scheme:
(define (square x) (* xx))

And:
(define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))

What is the difference between these two? Are both versions supported across all versions/dialects of lisp or is one more ""generalized"" than the other?
","In Scheme they are the same where they are both supported: (define (x ...) ...) is the same as (define x (lambda (...) ...)).  However certainly they are not the same in Lisp-family languages, which includes a huge variety of languages going back long before Scheme was invented.
However, Scheme standards have a notion of essential and non-essential or optional syntax: any implementation must support essential syntax but implementations are allowed not to support optional syntax.  In R4RS, (define <variable> <expression>) is essential but (define (variable ...) ...) is not.  In R5RS this distinction seems to have gone away: both forms are (I think) now essential.
I would be surprised if any implementations didn't support both forms, other than very minimal / tiny ones perhaps.
Note that if you have a Scheme with only the (define <variable> <expression>) version but which has a macro system you can pretty easily support the other version too:
(define-syntax defyne
  (syntax-rules ()
    [(_ (name) form ...)
     (defyne name (lambda () form ...))]
    [(_ (name formal ...) form ...)
     (defyne name (lambda (formal ...) form ...))]
    [(_ (name . formal) form ...)
     (defyne name (lambda formal form ...))]
    [(_ name expression)
     (define name expression)]))

(This macro may be buggy: I just typed it in.)
",,"Both ways of defining a function in Scheme (and thus Lisp) are supported and serve the same purpose, but there are some subtle differences that can be important depending on the context or dialect of Lisp you are using.

1. The first form:
   ```lisp
   (define (square x) (* xx))
   ```
   is a macro provided by Scheme/Scheme-like implementations to define functions in a more readable and concise way. Here, `xx` should be written as `(expt x 2)` for clarity, but typically it would use `(* x x)` or similar for simplicity.

2. The second form:
   ```lisp
   (define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))
   ```
   is using the `lambda` keyword to create an anonymous function and then assigning it to a variable named `square`. This method is more explicit about what's happening, as you are creating a lambda expression and then binding it to a name.

The key differences are:
- **Readability**: The first form with `(define (square x) ...)` is generally considered more readable because it explicitly names the function being defined.
- **Binding**: In the second form, `square` is bound directly to an anonymous function created by `lambda`. This means that any modifications or rebindings of `square` will affect this specific definition.

Both forms are supported in most Scheme implementations and many Common Lisp dialects. However, some Lisp dialects (like Clojure) might have different syntax for defining functions, but the concept remains similar.

In summary, both versions are valid and commonly used. The choice between them can depend on personal preference or the specific requirements of your code.",0.5734,[[0.40668834]],0.17848042929692615,0.3590508625057132,0.38202247191011235,0.027088036117381486,0.1438202247191011
"This is a follow-up of my previous question: Why do we need nil? Clearly, proper lists are used most of the time. But what is the purpose of an improper list?
","For no good reason.  The only thing that improper lists are truly good for is as part of the syntax for association lists—and even there, a custom syntax for key-value pairs would be better.  Any use you can think of for improper lists can be better implemented with record types—which, after all, subsume lists: you can define Lisp lists in terms of records, but not the other way around (because lists don't allow you define data structures whose type is disjoint from all other types in the language).
The abuse of pairs and lists to represent all types of data is what I like to call Lisp programmer's disease, and it's a real shame that so many Lisp advocates advocate for it.  I've had to clean up that stuff way too many times.
",,"In Lisp, `nil` serves a fundamental role beyond just being the end marker for lists. While it's true that proper lists are used extensively, there are several reasons why understanding and using improper lists is important.\n\nImproper lists allow you to have a list where the last element does not point to another cons cell (a pair of objects), but instead holds some other type of value directly. This can be useful in certain scenarios:\n1. **Flexibility**: Sometimes, you want to end a list with something other than `nil`, especially when working with heterogeneous data structures.\n2. **Data Representation**: Improper lists can represent specific data structures more naturally. For example, they are used to implement trees or other nested data structures where a node might have an associated value that is not another cons cell.\n3. **Legacy Code and Interoperability**: Many Lisp dialects and libraries expect certain behaviors from improper lists for compatibility reasons or because the original design choices made use of them.\n\nIn summary, while `nil` is crucial as the end marker for proper lists, improper lists provide flexibility and are sometimes necessary for representing complex data structures or maintaining backward compatibility.",0.5291,[[0.4777761]],0.1663848588093543,0.36604171799076785,0.4094955489614243,0.06567164179104477,0.1543026706231454
"So, I'm trying to learn Lisp, and I've come across a problem in the definition of what a String is.
I'm reading the ANSI Common Lisp by Paul Graham, and in this book it states that a String is a vector, or one-dimensional Array. 
So, I create a String:
(defvar *my-string* ""abc"")

And then I can access the first value of my-string this way:
(aref *my-string* 0)

But if it is a vector, why can't I access that element this way:
(svref *my-string* 0)

I mean, when I create a vector this way:
(defvar my-vec (make-array 4 :initial-element 1))

I can access first element using svref:
(svref my-vec 0) ; returns 1

I forgot to add error when I try svref on String:
""The value ""abc"" is not of type (SIMPLE-ARRAY T (*)).""
","String is a vector, but it isn't a simple-vector. svref takes a simple-vector as first argument.
You can check it by calling:
(vector-p *my-string*)

which returns true
Unlike: 
(simple-vector-p *my-string*)

which returns false.
Notice that (simple-vector-p my-vec) will return true as well, which confirms that make-array creates a simple-vector.
",,"In Common Lisp, a string is indeed represented as a kind of vector, but it's important to understand that strings are special types of vectors. The function `aref` works with arrays and vectors in general, which is why you can use it on your string *my-string*.

That's why you're encountering the error when trying to use `svref` on a string.\n\nTo directly access elements in a string, you should stick with `aref`. For example:\n(aref *my-string* 0)\nThis will correctly return the first character 'a'.\n\nOn the other hand, for vectors created using `make-array`, like your `my-vec`, `svref` works as expected because it is designed to work with simple arrays of specific types.",0.5818,[[0.32346011]],0.12340535397881204,0.3474085216044688,0.351219512195122,0.09852216748768473,0.22439024390243903

(define (my-apply f args)

In the implementation above, the `@args` syntax is used in combination with `eval`. The backquote and comma before `f` and `@args` create a list where `f` and each element of `args` are unevaluated until evaluated by `eval`. This effectively simulates how `apply` works.

S-EVAL evaluates a form in an environment and returns two values: the evaluation of the form and a boolean indicating whether some evaluation actually occurred or if the term was self-evaluating (a literal). This boolean is used to prevent transforming a term where a subterm was transformed by a recursive evaluation.
STEP-EVAL prints the form and calls S-EVAL, before calling itself recursively until evaluation terminates.

Abstraction? Partial application? I guess there is a much more simpler and clearer idea, what do we need it for, and WHERE to use it. Thanks!
","Well, in this case because mathematically the derivative of a function is a function.  So if you want a function which computes the derivative of a function then it's going to return a function.
And this is useful.  Imagine if you have a function called fplot which will plot a function between two values.  Then I can plot the function sin with
(fplot sin (- pi) pi)

Say.  Now if I want to plot the derivative of sin (let's imagine I didn't know it was cos), I can plot that:
(fplot (deriv sin) (- pi) pi)

fplot doesn't need to know anything at all about where the function it's plotting came from.  The alternative would be to write a special function to plot the derivative of a function, and then perhaps another one to plot the second derivative and so on, and then eventually some function which takes a function and an integer and plots that order of derivative of it or something.
And then you'd realise that, well, wouldn't it be better design to have a function whose job was to plot functions and another function whose job was to compute the functions which are the derivatives of functions, and then these things would compose together nicely.
",,"The code you provided uses a higher-order function approach where `deriv` is itself a function that takes another function `g` and returns a new function. This design allows for more flexibility and abstraction in your program. Here’s why it's useful to use the original definition of `deriv` rather than inline evaluation:

1. **Abstraction**: The original form of `deriv` abstracts the differentiation logic away from specific functions like `square`. You can pass any function `g` that you want to differentiate, making the `deriv` function reusable for differentiable functions.

2. **Partial Application**: By returning a new lambda function from `deriv`, you are effectively creating a partially applied version of the derivative operation. This means you can create an instance of the derivative of a specific function without needing to define it again and again. For example, when you call `((deriv square) 10)`, you are applying the derived function directly to `10`.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: Keeping differentiation logic separate from the functions being differentiated allows for better separation of concerns in your code. It makes your code cleaner and more modular.

The simplified version:
```lisp
(define (deriv g x)
  (/ (- (g (+ x dx)) (g x))
     dx))
```
While this works, it is not as flexible because you need to pass the `x` value explicitly every time you want to compute the derivative. The original form allows for a more generic and reusable approach.

In summary, using functions as return values in Lisp provides a powerful way to encapsulate behavior, reuse code, and apply partial application. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex or frequently used operations like differentiation.",0.5571,[[0.50245443]],0.18771906445620598,0.3740070740926595,0.40748440748440745,0.08350730688935283,0.18295218295218296

For example:
(require 'darkroom-mode)

Results in:
File error: Cannot open load file, darkroom-mode

I am using file-exists-p to test if certain other files exist but for this test I would assume I need to search my load-path. I am new to Lisp so this is stumping me.

; third arg non-nil means to not signal an error if file not found

From the documentation (C-h f require RET):
require is a built-in function in `C source code'.

(require feature &optional filename noerror)

If feature feature is not loaded, load it from filename.
If feature is not a member of the list `features', then the feature
is not loaded; so load the file filename.
If filename is omitted, the printname of feature is used as the file name,
and `load' will try to load this name appended with the suffix `.elc' or
`.el', in that order.  The name without appended suffix will not be used.
If the optional third argument noerror is non-nil,

"Why does (defun boolimplies (a b) (or (not a) b)) if called as 
(boolimplies 'a 'b) return B?
How does it arrive at this conclusion even when I don't use any boolean value (NIL,T) but just variable names?
","While only t and nil are booleans in Common Lisp, there are also generalized booleans. That is, all objects can be used as truth values, and only the symbol nil is false. You are passing symbols other than nil, which are true.
(Just to avoid any potential confusion: If you have variables a and b and want to use their values instead of symbols, just pass them unquoted.)
",,"The function `boolimplies` checks if `a` implies `b`. In logic, implication can be understood through the truth table:

- If `a` is false (i.e., `(not a)` evaluates to true), then regardless of what `b` is, the result of `(or (not a) b)` will be true. This means that if `a` is false, the implication holds.
- If `a` is true, then for the implication to hold, `b` must also be true.

When you call `(boolimplies 'a 'b)`, the function does not evaluate `'a` and `'b` to their respective boolean values. Instead, it treats them as symbols that might represent any value (including non-boolean values). 

In the context of logical implication, when `a` is a symbol representing a condition that can be either true or false, the expression `(not a)` will evaluate to an equivalent form of the negation of `a`. When this is combined with `b` using OR, if `a` evaluates to `false`, then the result is `true`.

So, even though you didn't provide boolean values for `'a` and `'b`, the function still follows logical rules. If `'a` represents a condition that can be false, the implication will hold true if `'b` is treated as any value (since `(or nil 'b)` evaluates to `'b`). This explains why the result of `(boolimplies 'a 'b)` is `B`, meaning the second argument, regardless of its actual content or type.",0.5184,[[0.29122563]],0.053256562174006324,0.3212180353065257,0.23728813559322035,0.034129692832764506,0.12881355932203392

","As Rainer Joswig points out in the comments, you could simply specify the element type of your result vector:
(concatenate '(vector (unsigned-byte 8)) array-A array-B)

Note that the documentation says:

If the result-type is a subtype of vector, then if the implementation
  can determine the element type specified for the result-type, the

"How do I implement a program in Scheme taking the elements of a given list and returning a new list where the elements are random gatherings of the previous list? I would like it to work for any length. For example:
Input: '(a e i o u), output: '((a e) (i o) (u)) for length 2.
My attempts (making use of for/list) are being clumsy and based on recursion. I have divided the tasks  as suggested by Óscar:

Select n elements randomly from a list l:
(define (pick-n-random l n)
  (take (shuffle l) n))

Remove a list l2 from a list l1:

Then, and that is my problem: how do I recurse over this process to get the intended program? Should I use for/list to paste all sublists got by this process 1. and 2.?
","It's easier if we split the problem into chunks. First, let's write a couple of procedures that will allow us to take or drop n elements from a list, with appropriate results if there are not enough elements left in the list (if not for this, we could have used the built-in take and drop):
(define (take-up-to lst n)
  (if (or (<= n 0) (null? lst))
      '()
      (cons (car lst) (take-up-to (cdr lst) (sub1 n)))))

(define (drop-up-to lst n)
  (if (or (<= n 0) (null? lst))
      lst
      (drop-up-to (cdr lst) (sub1 n))))

With the above two procedures in place, it's easy to create another procedure to group the elements in a list into n-sized sublists:
(define (group lst n)
  (if (null? lst)
      '()
      (cons (take-up-to lst n)
            (group (drop-up-to lst n) n))))

Finally, we combine our grouping procedure with shuffle, which randomizes the contents of the list:
(define (random-groups lst n)
  (group (shuffle lst) n))

It works as expected:
(random-groups '(a e i o u) 2)
=> '((e a) (u i) (o))

The idea is to recursively split the list into smaller sublists based on the desired sublist lengths.\n\nFirst, define a function that generates random sublist lengths for each step of recursion. Then, use those lengths to partition the original list.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n```scheme\n(define (random-gather lst)\n  (define (helper remaining lst result)\n    (if (null? remaining)\n        result\n        (let* ((length (car remaining))\n               (sublist (pick-n-random lst length)))\n          (helper (cdr remaining) (cut lst sublist) (cons sublist result)))))\n  (reverse (helper (iota (- (length lst) 1) 2) lst '())))\n\n(define (pick-n-random l n)\n  (take (shuffle l) n))\n\n(define (cut l1 l2)\n  (cond ((null? l1)\n         '())\n        ((not (member (car l1) l2))\n         (cons (car l1) (cut (cdr l1) l2)))\n        (else\n         (cut (cdr l1) l2))))\n\n;; Example usage:\n(random-gather '(a e i o u)) ;; This will return a list of random sublists based on the input list\n```\nIn this implementation, `random-gather` uses recursion to create the desired sublist structure. The function `helper` is defined within `random-gather` and takes care of splitting the original list according to the lengths generated by `iota`.

Here’s how you can do this:

1. Define the lambda expression.
2. Use `setf` to set the function of the symbol held by `funct-name` to the lambda expression.

Example code:

```lisp
(defparameter funct-name 'addone)

(funcall funct-name 3) ;; This will also output 4

","No, the answer in the book is right. Note that the expression has 3 occurrences of (quote ()), to create 3 lists. Then it conses various atoms onto the lists. Your answer contains 5 lists, not 3.
(quote ()) simply returns an empty list. (cons 1 (quote ())) adds one item to the empty list to yield (1).
",,"You are correct that the expected output of evaluating the provided expression is (car ((quote ((a b c))))). Let's break down why this is the case. The `cons` function in Lisp creates a pair, with the first argument as the car and the second as the cdr. Given your definitions:\n\n- `rep-car` refers to `car`, which extracts the first element of its argument.\n- `rep-quote` refers to `quote`, which prevents evaluation of its argument.\n- `rep-a`, `rep-b`, and `rep-c` are symbols that refer to themselves: `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.\n\nWhen you evaluate the expression step by step, it simplifies as follows:\n\n1. (quote ()) is a list with no elements, represented as () in Lisp syntax.
2. ((cons rep-quote (cons ...))) creates a nested structure where each element is quoted.
3. The innermost structure (rep-c) becomes 'c after being evaluated by `car`.
4. Each subsequent cons call builds the list `(a b c)` while quoting it at each level until finally, the outermost car extracts 'a from the structure.\n\nHowever, when you evaluate this expression in a Lisp interpreter or environment, the nested quoting is preserved as (quote ((a b c))), because `quote` ensures that its argument is not evaluated. Therefore, the correct answer should indeed be (car ((quote ((a b c))))), reflecting the structure of the quoted list.",0.5501,[[0.42087806]],0.08240554155275584,0.34862119775476413,0.19014084507042253,0.02127659574468085,0.11267605633802817

Another part of my question: is (safety 0) safe? Few of my functions use explicit declarations of variable types, what will happen to the others? Should I omit (safety 0) to avoid problems that might occur due to missing type-checking?
","I would avoid setting compilation policies globally, since ""as with other defining macros, it is unspecified whether or not the compile-time side-effects of a declaim persist after the file has been compiled"". If you really want to use a global policy per file, you can use the locally special form at top-level (subforms of a top-level locally remain top-level forms)
(locally (declare (optimize speed #| ... whatever ... |#))

   (defun compute-foo (x) 
     (1+ x))

I tend to use declarations sparingly, usually only local within a function, i.e.,
(defun compute-foo (x)
   (declare (fixnum x))
   (1+ x))

Many modern Lisp compilers (like SBCL) have become pretty good at figuring types out. Further, I'd never use (safety 0) globally, since it may be dangerous, in particular during development, when things haven't really settled down and mistakes are common.
",,"Inserting `(optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) (debug 0) (space 0))` at the top of each file is not a good idea because it can lead to inconsistent optimization settings across your project. Instead, you should define these settings in one specific place, such as a system definition file if you are using ASDF for managing your Lisp system. This ensures consistency and makes maintenance easier.

Regarding `(safety 0)`, setting safety to 0 disables most runtime checks, which can indeed make your code faster but also less safe. If some of your functions rely on explicit variable type declarations for correctness or debugging purposes, disabling these checks could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs that are harder to detect at runtime.

If you want to avoid potential issues due to missing type-checking, it's recommended not to use `(safety 0)` globally unless absolutely necessary. Instead, consider using finer-grained optimizations and enabling safety checks where needed.

"I've been learning Lisp recently (Scheme, Racket and Clojure to various extents) and have read the corresponding literature on famous Playstation developer Naughty Dog.
This Gamasutra article mentions that their streaming engine actually streams in game code in addition to game data.
Now, they have a dialect of Lisp called GOAL which they use extensively.
I know of Lisp's ""Code as Data"", although I have yet to grok this concept fully.  So, I was wondering if the ability to stream code is a property of their code being Lisp data or compiled machine code, as opposed to being a generic design pattern that can be used in many languages?
Can someone point me to literature on this topic?
Bonus: Can someone point me to literature on long-term-listening-compilers as mentioned in the Wikipedia article?
","A 'Listener' in Lisp speak is a REPL (Read Eval Print Loop). Listeners usually provide several services like integrated debugger, command histories, command interpreters, and more. In many cases the Listener runs inside the Lisp one is using. In some cases all code typed to a REPL/Listener is compiled before executing (examples are Clozure CL, SBCL). If that is not the case, the code can be compiled on demand (see the COMPILE or COMPILE-FILE functions in Common Lisp).
Here I would guess that the development environment was implemented in Allegro Common Lisp and the runtime runs on a Playstation. The development environment provides an interface to talk to the runtime and allows to compile code and to download it into the runtime. I would guess that the compiler does not run on the Playstation, but inside the development environment. The Listener then also provides functionality to look at the state of the running application on the Playstation, including the symbol table. So, one connects the development environment to the Playstation's running application and one can interact with that, including changing data and code.
Since Lisps typical can load both source and compiled code at runtime, 'streaming' code is not that difficult. It just means that one loads the code (possibly in the background) while the player moves around in the game. If the code is organized in a certain way, it can also be garbage collected once it is no longer needed. For example if a 'room' in a game is an object and the room points to various functions by name, the functions can be autoloaded on demand if the player is in the room. If the player leaves the room the code can be automatically or semi-automatically unloaded. In a typical Lisp the garbage collector would collect unreferenced code. In a game that might not be a task of the GC, but of some other more 'manual' process. This would be a functionality of the GOAL runtime. Compare that with the stock JVM which could not garbage collect unloaded code (AFAIK).
",,"The ability to stream code in GOAL (used by Naughty Dog) is more closely related to Lisp's 'code as data' property rather than being a generic design pattern applicable to any language. In Lisp, code can be represented as data structures (such as lists and vectors), which means that the same mechanisms used for processing data can also be used for evaluating code. This makes it possible to treat programs as files or streams of data, allowing parts of them to be loaded on demand, modified at runtime, and executed dynamically. However, this is not a generic feature but rather a characteristic of Lisp's design philosophy.\n\nFor literature on this topic, you might want to look into papers that discuss dynamic evaluation in Lisp and its implementation in different dialects such as GOAL. Some key concepts include macros, reader macros, and the read-eval-print loop (REPL) which are fundamental to understanding how code can be treated as data.\n\nRegarding long-term-listening-compilers, this term is less common in literature and might refer to a specific implementation detail or concept that evolves with new compiler technologies. The Wikipedia article likely refers to advanced compilation techniques where the compiler adapts over time based on runtime feedback.

What happens if you replace k with 0?
It would be much more helpful if you formatted this code with typical conventions, and probably if you isolated the particular part of the code that's problematic.  That is, (remove-duplicates …) isn't the problem here, you could have removed it.  With some more conventional formatting, and some comments, your code is:
(remove-duplicates
 (let ((c nil))
   (loop for k from 0 to (length ""abc"")                  ; k starts at 0

What's going to happen if you try to loop for j from 0 to anything by k?  You're pretty much saying, ""start with j at 0, then increment it by 0 for the next iteration…"" so j never gets anywhere.  This really could have been caught with a print or format.  I know that's not the same as using a debugger, but sometimes the simplest ways are the quickest:

Lisp emphasizes clarity through its prefix notation and S-expression structure (Sexpressions), which are essentially lists where each element can be either a value or another list.

Each top-level form is first read in completely.  Reading, however, involves resolution of the respective symbols.  Since ASDF is not yet loaded during read time of your eval-when form, the symbol asdf:*central-registry* cannot be resolved yet, and this produces the mentioned read error.
",,"The issue you're encountering likely arises from how Common Lisp environments handle package usage. In your first example, `(require 'asdf)` is placed within an `eval-when` form that executes at compile-time and load-time. This ensures that the ASDF package is loaded before any forms following it are evaluated.

However, in your second example, `(require 'asdf)` is followed directly by `(push #p",0.5492,[[0.35091921]],0.10615004469684988,0.2742025741466144,0.3862068965517242,0.0839160839160839,0.1931034482758621
"What exactly is the definition of a Common Lisp Cons Cell? How is a Cons Cell different than a standard linked list item? After all, both the cons cell and the linked list item have a value and a pointer to the next cell or item... or is this understanding wrong?
","Cons cells in general hold two pointers that can point to anything. General usage of course is to point to a ""value"" with the left one, and to another Cons cell (or nil) with the ""right"" one.
",,"A Common Lisp Cons Cell is a fundamental data structure used for storing pairs of values. It consists of two parts: a 'car' and a 'cdr'. The 'car' holds the first value, while the 'cdr' can hold either another cons cell or a pointer to any other object in memory. This recursive nature allows cons cells to be chained together to form linked lists.

In contrast to a standard linked list item, which typically has just two components (a value and a pointer to the next node), a cons cell's 'cdr' component can point to either another cons cell or an arbitrary object. This flexibility makes cons cells more versatile than simple linked list nodes for constructing complex data structures such as trees, graphs, and even nested lists.

Your understanding that both have a value and a pointer is correct, but the key difference lies in the recursive nature of the 'cdr' in a cons cell, which allows for more sophisticated data manipulation compared to a standard linked list node.",0.5551,[[0.42179327]],0.07118511769808074,0.30384271671134944,0.23076923076923078,0.07766990291262135,0.15384615384615385

... this order [left to right or right to left] should always be considered to be an implementation detail, and one should never write programs that depend on some particular order. For instance, a sophisticated compiler might optimize a program by varying the order in which subexpressions are evaluated.

"I understand that Lisps are (usually) dynamically typed, but I guess their values still have types. Functions are values in lisps, so I wonder what is the type of function +?
List of numbers -> number seemed most likely, so I tried (+ '(2 3)) and (+ [2 3]) in Clojure, but neither worked.
Is it possible to query the type of a value (or expression) in Clojure REPL?
","It's actually quite a complex type that is tricky to define formally for a number of reasons:

It's a multi-arity function (accepts an variable number of parameters). Note that this is different from a function that takes a single parameter which is a list of numbers. If you want to use + on a list of numbers you need to use apply e.g. (apply + [1 2 3 4])
Each parameter can be a Number of any type. There are many possible number types, indeed anything that extends the java.lang.Number base class would suffice.
Inlined versions are defined which can directly produce primitive types as a result.

There isn't an easy way to determine this from the REPL. But you might be interested in Typed Clojure which provides a type system along with methods to define types and do corresponding type checking in Clojure. It uses a neat approach called ""gradual typing"", so you can add type annotations just where you need them: you don't need to assign types to the whole program at once.
",,"In Lisp and Clojure specifically, functions like `+` are not first-class values that you can directly query for their type using a built-in function.

",,"In Common Lisp, including SBCL, the `sort` function does not modify the original list by default. However, the behavior you're observing suggests that an additional argument specifying a temporary sequence for sorting might have been passed or there's some external factor affecting your environment. 

When you use `(sort y #'>)`, the `sort` function creates a new sorted list and returns it. In this case, it returns `(9 7 6 5 4 2)` but doesn't modify `y`. The fact that `y` is now altered to `(7 6 5 4 2)` suggests either you have a variable named `y` in your environment that was reassigned or there might be an error in the code execution context.

To avoid modifying variables, ensure you are sorting into a new list and not overwriting existing bindings unintentionally. For example:

I'm a beginner as far as LISP goes, so I'd appreciate a clear answer to the following question: how do you write a recursive lambda function in lisp?
Thanks.
","LET conceptually binds the variables at the same time, using the same enclosing environment to evaluate the expressions. Use LABELS instead, that also binds the symbols f0 and f1 in the function namespace:
(defun fib (n)
  (labels ((f0 (n) (if (= n 0) 0 (f1 n 0 1)))
           (f1 (a b n) (if (= n 1) b (f1 (- n 1) b (+ a b)))))
    (f0 n)))

",,"The issue with your approach is that you are trying to use `f0` and `f1` inside each other's definitions within a single `let` form. In Lisp, when you define a function or lambda expression using `funcall`, the referenced functions must be defined before they are used.

To achieve what you want, you can define the inner recursive function directly within the outer one without using separate lambda expressions for `f0` and `f1`. Here's how you can rewrite your Fibonacci function to use a single recursive lambda expression:

```lisp
(defun fib (n)
  (labels ((fib-r (a b n)
             (if (= n 1) b (fib-r b (+ a b) (- n 1)))))
    (fib-r 0 1 n)))
```

In this version, `fib-r` is defined within the `fib` function using the `labels` special form. The `labels` macro allows you to define local functions that can call each other recursively and refer to themselves by name. This way, both `a`, `b`, and `n` are passed as arguments directly, making it a single recursive lambda function.

This should work correctly for your Fibonacci sequence computation.",0.6613,[[0.35515873]],0.21887862711628797,0.41794625360112725,0.3292181069958848,0.14107883817427386,0.21399176954732507

","Use standard formatting (see e. g. Practical Common Lisp).
(defun remplacee (x y l)
  (mapcar #'(lambda (c)
              ((if (eq c x) y x)))
          l))

Use correct spelling.  Since replace is already part of the standard, we'll use some placeholder prefix, e. g. my-.
(defun my-replace (x y l)
  (mapcar #'(lambda (c)
              ((if (eq c x) y x)))
          l))

The form ((if (eq c x) y x)) is not valid here.  The first item of an evaluated list must be a function designator: either a symbol naming a function, or a lambda form (i. e. a list starting with the symbol lambda).  The first item here is neither.
What you obviously meant was (if (eq c x) y x), i. e., the inner form not wrapped in another list.
(defun my-replace (x y l)
  (mapcar #'(lambda (c)
              (if (eq c x) y x))
          l))

This almost works, but it uses eq, which compares only by object identity.  This is usually not general enough, except for comparing interned symbols or keywords.  The usual default comparison function is eql.
(defun my-replace (x y l)
  (mapcar #'(lambda (c)
              (if (eql c x) y x))

I'd recommend using more descriptive names:
(defun my-replace (item with list)
  (mapcar #'(lambda (c)
              (if (eql c item) with item))
          list))

Optionally, it can make sense to allow different comparators:
(defun my-replace (item with list &key (test #'eql))
  (mapcar #'(lambda (c)
              (if (funcall test c item) with item))
          list))

(ff [1 2 3 4 5])

The mapping function body isn't being executed. If I remove the go block in the last line, it works as expected.
This function gives the same problem:
(defn ff [t]
  (let [ch (chan 5)]
    (map (fn [i]
          (println i)) t)
    (>!! ch 0)))

","map runs lazily.
When it's not the last form in the let block, the result isn't being evaluated, so the mapping function doesn't get executed.
This'd happen without the go blocks.
If you explicitly want to evaluate a sequence for side-effects (like println), use doseq. If you need a lazy sequence to be evaluated eagerly (e.g. it depends on a network connection that will close), wrap it in doall
",,"The issue you're encountering is due to the asynchronous nature of the `go` block and how it interacts with the `map` function. In Clojure's concurrency model, `go` blocks run concurrently within a separate thread and do not block the main thread. However, when you use `map`, it returns an iterator that needs to be processed (e.g., by calling `doseq`, `doall`, or converting it to a collection), which doesn't happen in your code.

When you remove the `go` block, the `map` function is evaluated and its results are printed immediately. However, with the `go` block present, the `map` function returns an iterator that isn't processed further, so the `println` statements don’t execute as expected.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the `map` function's results are processed in some way before the `go` block runs. Here’s a modified version of your code:

```clojure
(defn ff [t]
  (let [ch (chan 5)]
    (doseq [i t]   ;; Process each item in 't'
      (println i)) ;; This will print each item immediately
    (go (>! ch 0))))
```

Alternatively, you can use `doall` to force the evaluation of the `map` form:

```clojure
(defn ff [t]
  (let [ch (chan 5)]
    (doall (map (fn [i] 
                  (println i)) t))
    (go (>! ch 0))))
```

In both cases, the `doseq` and `doall` ensure that the `map` function's results are evaluated before the `go` block is executed.",0.5313,[[0.51011375]],0.08631199402736082,0.3377420878601795,0.33333333333333337,0.07236842105263158,0.16993464052287582

","Use DESTRUCTURING-BIND, which can do a whole heck of a lot more than tuple unpacking. Like assignment by keywords, and optional parameters, etc. Really, anything you can do with a function's parameter list.
But if you don't actually have a list to destructure, and want to set a bunch of variables at once, use PSETF:

(psetf n 1
       p 2)

You can also use SETF, but PSETF is a closer analog of tuple assignment: it works for swapping/permuting values, for instance.
# Python
n, p = p, n
x, y, z = z, x, y


;; Lisp
(psetf n p
       p n)
(psetf x z
       y x
       z y)

Actually you could probably get away with a mundane LET.
Also, don't bother with SETQ for anything. Use SETF/PSETF because they are better, and moreover the only way to perform certain types of assignments.

","For many types of data, what you write can be read back. But in the case of procedures you can't, and thus it gets outputted as an unreadable value.
Procedure equality is like opaque structure equality: it only checks identity. If this all you need, you will still be able to store the procedure somewhere and use check-equal?

"I am reading a book about Common LISP and the author says : ""An alist consists of key/value pairs stored in a list.""
So it made me think, is this the same thing as a Dictionnary in C# or not?
If so why?
","There is a distinction between abstract concepts and concrete data-structures.
A dictionary is an abstract concept - a mapping of keys to values. It can be implemented with several different approaches:

as a list: of key-value pairs (Lisp's alists), a flat list of interleaved keys and values (Lisp's plists), as a pair of two lists of keys and values
as a table, be it Lisp's hash-table/Java's HashMap or some other kind of table
as a tree (Java's TreeMap)
etc

C#'s Dictionary is a data-structure that supports (amortized) constant lookup time, like CL's hash-table. In this regard it is different from alist, that has linear lookup time. Also alists don't depend on element's hash-code in order to store/retrieve it. The API of alists is also different, than Dictionary's. There's assoc and rassoc to lookup an element from the left side and right side respectively. (So, unlike in a conventional dictionary, there can be multiple mappings of the same key to different values in an alist). Also there are acons and pairlis to construct an alist.
EDIT And, finally, there's no standard function to remove an item from alist.
You can delete an element with (remove key alist :key #'car). But note, that this operation leaves the original list intact and returns a modified list as a result.
",,"In Common Lisp, an alist (association list) and a dictionary (also known as a hash table or hash map in some languages like C#) serve similar purposes but have different implementations.

   add-two
   add-three])

Maybe something akin to Python's dir(__builtins__).
Additional tip would be appreciated.
","You could collect a list of all of the external symbols in the COMMON-LISP package:
(let (lst)
  (do-external-symbols (s (find-package 'common-lisp) lst)
    (push s lst)))

There are a lot of them!  Check out the symbol index of the hyperspec.
A lot of these symbols you'll probably never use, and I'm not sure it's worthwhile to look at each of them.
I would recommend becoming somewhat familiar with all of the special forms:
block      let*                  return-from      
catch      load-time-value       setq             
eval-when  locally               symbol-macrolet  
flet       macrolet              tagbody          
function   multiple-value-call   the              
go         multiple-value-prog1  throw            
if         progn                 unwind-protect   
labels     progv                                  
let        quote                                  

Now, CHARACTER in particular is a standard type.  The hyperspec has a list of those as well, but I don't think there's a standard way to find all of the types programmatically.
",,"In Common Lisp, there isn't a direct equivalent of Python's `dir(__builtins__)` to list all built-in functions and special forms. However, you can get a sense of the available symbols by using `(find-all-symbols)`, which returns a list of all known symbol names in the current environment. Keep in mind that this includes user-defined symbols as well.

For a more curated list of built-in functions and special forms, you might want to refer to the official Common Lisp HyperSpec (Hyper Textified Revised report), which is an extensive online reference for Common Lisp. Alternatively, you can use the `describe` function on specific symbols or special forms to get detailed information about them.

To explore and learn more about Common Lisp built-ins interactively, consider using a development environment like SLIME with Emacs, which provides convenient tools for exploring and evaluating code.",0.4902,[[0.38152582]],0.08047796446556368,0.20013111912774387,0.33220338983050846,0.0750853242320819,0.1423728813559322
"I accidentally forgot to put the else in the following cond expression, and something strange occurred.
(define (abs x)
  (cond ((< x 0) x)
        ((= x 0) 0)
        (+ 1 2 1001)
        ))

> (abs 1)
1001
> 

the result of (abs 1) is not the result of (+ 1 2 1001)，which is 1004, but the last element of the arguments of the expression (+ 1 2 1001).
the cond form is 
(cond (<p1>,<e1>)
      (<p2>,<e2>)
      (<p3>,<e3>)
      ...
      (<pn>,<en>))

there is no predicate in the expression (+ 1 2 1001), so I wonder if the procedure + has been considered as predicate, and if it always evaluates as true, selecting the last element to return. Is that how it works???
","Sequencing: begin form in Racket allows you to sequence multiple expressions. It evaluates each expression from left to right and the final result is the last expression.
Syntax: The syntax for cond shows that multiple expressions can be sequenced in the rhs of a clause without a begin. Such a thing is called an implicit begin. 
Semantics: According to the documentation, cond evaluates the rhs of a clause if the lhs is anything but #f. Therefore + in the position of the test-expression evaluates the rhs of the clause. 
Style: By convention, using square brackets in a few key places makes Racket code even more readable. The clause of a cond is one of these places. 
The following snippet is equivalent to your snippet:
#lang racket

(define (abs x)
  (cond [(< x 0) x]
        [(= x 0) 0]
        [+ (begin 1
                  2
                  1001)]))
(abs 1) 
; => 1001

",,"In Lisp, a `cond` expression is used to evaluate its predicates one by one until one returns true (or non-nil). When no predicate evaluates to true and there's an `else` clause, it will be executed. In your case, the `cond` form lacks an `else` clause, but the interpreter doesn't treat the subsequent expressions as predicates. Instead, the interpreter sees `(+ 1 2 1001)` as a standalone expression that needs to be evaluated and returns its result if no true predicate is found. This behavior is not treating `+` as a predicate; rather, it's simply evaluating expressions in order from top to bottom until a true predicate is encountered or all are exhausted without an `else`. The reason `(abs 1)` returned `1001` instead of the expected `2` is because no predicate evaluated to true, and thus, the last expression `(+ 1 2 1001)` was simply evaluated.",0.523,[[0.42945539]],0.1333411895181633,0.29057859703020994,0.4013840830449827,0.048780487804878044,0.17993079584775085
"Say, if I have a Lisp program, which uses (eval 'sym) and looks it up in its symbol-table does it actually perform better than something like aClass.getField(""sym"", anInstance) in ""static"" languages?
","In general (modulo implementation issues like bytecode vs native code or code generation quality), languages with metalinguistic abstraction provide more power to create programs that outperform programs that can be created in comparable timeframe with language that lacks such abstractions. The case is that when you write an implementation for your own language, you have more information to make much more powerful optimizations than compiler for base language can do. There are numerous examples of this in practice.
Also, you seem to mix together the reflection (being a particular case of 'open implementation') and metalinguistic abstraction. Metalinguistic abstraction is about building new languages on top of base languages and reflection (or 'open implementation') is about exposing program's internals to the program itself.
In your particular example (of course, module implementation issues like bytecode vs native code or code generation quality), (eval 'sym) is probably faster. The reason is that 'sum is a symbol object and not a string. Evaluating a symbol means taking its value cell. So eval has to do only several things:

Dispatch on an object type (in this case - a symbol) (e.g., by using a value tag to go through jump table)
Extract symbol's value (by dereferencing a symbol structure)

But Java example has more things to do:

Find a field given its name. This requires e.g. calculating a hash of a string and using hashtable
Extract the field's value (by dereferencing instance pointer at an offset specific to field)
Box the value (if it's not a reference)

The particulary expensive part is calculating the hash and going through hashtable.

"According to CLHS entry for the INTERSECTION function (http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_isec_.htm):

For every pair that satifies the test, exactly one of the two elements
of the pair will be put in the result.

My problem is that i need to know which one of the two elements of the pair will be put in the result, which matters when, for example  :key #'car  is used to extract the arguments to test against, since the cdr might be different. I would like to have a guarantee that either always the first or always the second element will be put in the result. Am I missing something or is this just unspecified behaviour, so I shouldnt use it for my case?
","intersection simply doesn't make the guarantee you want; it implements set-theoretic intersection with a lot of extras, but just not that extra. You'll have to roll your own.
",,"Based on the Common Lisp HyperSpec (CLHS) documentation for the INTERSECTION function, the behavior described is indeed unspecified. The specification states that for every pair satisfying the test, exactly one of the two elements will be put in the result, but it does not specify which element (the car or cdr) will be chosen. This means you cannot rely on a consistent choice between the first and second element when using :key #'car to extract arguments for comparison.

Given your requirement for consistency—either always choosing the car or always choosing the cdr—you should use a custom approach that explicitly specifies this behavior, rather than relying on INTERSECTION alone. You could implement a custom function that iterates over the lists and applies your desired selection logic.",0.5044,[[0.21156518]],0.03928933796873643,0.2777777777777778,0.17721518987341772,0.0,0.10126582278481013
"Is there a way to sort a list made of only characters in alphabetic order (from ""a"" to ""z""), such as: (list c m a y k) => (list a c k m y)?
I didn't found a sort like that, so i thought this could solve the problem:
cl-prompt> (setq q (mapcar 'string '(c m a y k))) => (""C"" ""M"" ""A"" ""Y"" ""K"")
cl-prompt> (sort q 'string<) => (""A"" ""C"" ""K"" ""M"" ""Y"")

At this point i'm stuck, because by using the char converter the output will not be the list i want.
Example:
char (string 'a) 0 => #\A

And i will have a list made of: (#\A #\C #\K #\M #\Y), which is not the result i want.
","In the case of (c m a y k), you have a list of symbols.
In the case of (#\A #\C #\K #\M #\Y), you have a list of characters.
If you want to sort a list of symbols according to the symbol names, you can do (I am assuming the list is bound to the variable foo below):
(setq foo (sort foo #'string< :key #'symbol-name))

Note that the :key #'symbol-name could be argued to be superfluous, as string< actually operates on ""string designators"", but it is much clearer to a human reader that you are indeed intending to sort the list based on symbol names if you say so explicitly.
",,"You are on the right track with using `sort` and `string<`. However, you need to ensure that the elements remain as characters.

"I am doing exercise 3.13 from SICP but I am unsure of my answer.

Exercise 3.13: Consider the following make-cycle procedure, which uses
  the last-pair procedure defined in Exercise 3.12:
(define (make-cycle x)   (set-cdr! (last-pair x) x)   x)
Draw a box-and-pointer diagram that shows the structure z created by 
(define z (make-cycle (list 'a 'b 'c)))

I'm trying to understand why
(last-pair z)

becomes an infinite loop. Ignoring the box-and-pointer diagram, here is how I understand it:
(set-cdr! (last-pair x) x)

(last-pair x) would be the pair (cons 'c '()), then when we do set-cdr! the pair would become:
(cons 'c (cons 'a (cons 'b (cons 'c (cons 'a (cons 'b (cons 'c (cons 'a (cons 'b (cons 'c ...))))))))))

is my understanding correct?
","No.
Your answer appears to indicate that (last-pair x) is the result of calling cons infinitely many times.
Not so.
x is still just 3 cons cells, but the last one points to the first one, creating a loop (a snake biting itself on the tail).
",,"Your understanding is close but not entirely accurate. Let's break it down step-by-step using a box-and-pointer diagram for clarity and then explain why (last-pair z) becomes an infinite loop.\n\nThe structure created by `(define z (make-cycle (list 'a 'b 'c)))` looks like this initially:\n```lisp\n(a . (b . (c . nil)))\n```\nThen, after calling `make-cycle`, the last-pair of the list is set to point back to the first element, creating a cycle. The structure now looks like this:\n```lisp\n(a . (b . (c . a)))\n```\nHere's how it would look in a box-and-pointer diagram:\n```\n   +---+   +---+   +---+\n   | a |-->| b |-->| c |\n   +---+   +---+   +---+\n       ^           |\n       |           +---> nil\n       |\n       +-------------> (points back to a)\n```\nWhen you call `(last-pair z)`, it will follow the cdr pointers until it reaches the end of the list, but because the last element points back to `a`, it will keep looping indefinitely.

edit: fixed recursive call

how to test whether one list is a member of another
",,"The issue you are encountering is due to the incorrect use of 'eq' and 'member'. The function 'member' returns a sublist of elements from *DSTATES* that match the given element, so when it doesn't find a match, it returns nil (or () in Common Lisp). However, 'eq' checks for exact object identity rather than structural equality. Since nil is not an empty list, your condition will always be true.

To fix this, you should use 'null' or 'not' to check if the result of 'member' is nil:

",,"To achieve the desired output of a flat list of atoms from the nested S-expression list, you need to ensure that all nested structures are flattened.

"I tried to implement a natural sort:

Break 21 [92]>

Unfortunately, the code above does not work. 
Could someone help me to get a natural sort function?
","
Unfortunately, the code above does not work.

It looks like it worked.  After all, you explicitly asked to sort by string comparison, and according to a string comparison, ""2.txt"" is between ""13.txt"", and ""23.txt"".  If you want to sort numerically, you could use a key function that would read the number from the beginning of the string.  Also, sort is destructive, so you shouldn't use it on literal data (like a quoted list).
At any rate, it's not too hard to cobble together something that will get you the sort of sorting that you're looking for. Here's a definition for a natural-string-lessp function:
(defun natural-string-lessp (a b)
  (multiple-value-bind (ai aend)
      (parse-integer a :junk-allowed t)
    (multiple-value-bind (bi bend)
        (parse-integer b :junk-allowed t)
      (or (and ai
               (or (not bi)
                   (and bi
                        (or (< ai bi)
                            (and (= ai bi)
                                 (string-lessp a b :start1 aend :start2 bend))))))
          (and (not ai)
               (not bi)
               (string-lessp a b))))))

It only handles the leading numbers, and not numbers in the middle of a string, so, e.g., ""a-100-foo.txt"" will still come before ""a-3-foo.txt"", but it might be sufficient for your needs.  Here's an example of its use:
(let ((sss (copy-list '(""1.txt"" ""10.txt"" ""13.txt"" ""12.txt""
                        ""2.txt"" ""23.txt""))))
  (sort sss #'natural-string-lessp))
;=> (""1.txt"" ""2.txt"" ""10.txt"" ""12.txt"" ""13.txt"" ""23.txt"")

The documentation for parse-integer and the keyword arguments for string-lessp may be helpful.
A more robust implementation would figure out how to turn each string into a sequence of strings and numbers, (e.g., ""12.txt"" &rightarrow; (12 "".txt"")) and then sort those lists lexicographically with an ordering among types (e.g., numbers before strings), and with an ordering within each type.
",,"To achieve natural sorting in Common Lisp, you need a custom comparator that can handle numeric parts within strings. Here is an example of how you could implement such a function using regular expressions to split the strings into numbers and non-numeric parts, which are then compared appropriately.\n\n```lisp\n(defun natural-sort-key (string)\n  (map 'vector #'(lambda (part) (if (integerp (parse-integer part :junk-allowed t))\n                                    (parse-integer part)\n                                    part))\n       (uiop:split-string string \",0.6711,[[0.24139573]],0.03488183875513479,0.14646688606962116,0.23291139240506328,0.055979643765903316,0.12658227848101264
"I am trying to parse lisp input to python list. But when I parse the input I get list of strings but I want individual element as int.
Example: When I parse following input: ""(2 (10 (5 11))) (5 6) (4)""

I use: [[map(int, x) for x in lst] for lst in test] to convert the strings to int but this function will only parse nested list of level 2. But if I have a nested list of more than 2, how should I use it to parse?
I tried pyparsing but I didn't understand it properly.
","If you want to use pyparsing, you could do so without any postprocessing as follows.
import pyparsing as pp

integer = pp.Word(pp.nums).setParseAction(lambda m:int(m[0]))
expr = pp.Forward()
expr << pp.nestedExpr(content=pp.OneOrMore(integer | expr))
manyExpr = pp.OneOrMore(expr)

print manyExpr.parseString('(2 (10 (5 11))) (5 6) (4)')
    #returns [[2, [10, [5, 11]]], [5, 6], [4]]

This first defines an integer as something consisting only of numbers, and tells pyparsing how to convert it from a string of numbers to an integer object.  Next, it makes defines an expression as a list of expressions or integers inside parentheses.  Finally, in order to parse your example, it looks for many consecutive expressions.
",,"To handle deeply nested lists and convert string elements to integers in Python after parsing Lisp input, you can use a recursive function. This approach ensures that all levels of nesting are processed correctly. Here's an example of how you might do this using the `ast.literal_eval` method for safety and then recursively converting strings to integers:\n\n```python\nimport ast\n\ndef parse_and_convert(input_str):\n    # Safely evaluate the string as a Python literal (e.g., list)\n    lst = ast.literal_eval(input_str)\n    def recursive_convert(lst):\n        return [recursive_convert(x) if isinstance(x, list) else int(x) for x in lst]\n    return recursive_convert(lst)\n\n# Example usage:\ntest_input = '(2 (10 (5 11))) (5 6) (4)'\nresult = parse_and_convert(test_input)\nprint(result)\n```\nThis code first safely evaluates the string input to a Python list using `ast.literal_eval`, which is safer than directly evaluating strings due to security concerns. Then, it uses a recursive function `recursive_convert` to traverse and convert all string elements to integers, even in deeply nested structures.",0.5684,[[0.18801481]],0.1621049930563292,0.3103317528202924,0.2557377049180328,0.04620462046204621,0.15081967213114755
"What is the Lisp convention about how many semicolons to use for different kinds of comments (and what the level of indentation for various numbers of semicolons should be)?  
Also, is there any convention about when to use semicolon comments and when to use #|multiline comments|# (assuming they exist and exist on multiple implementations)?
","In Common Lisp:
;;;; At the top of source files

;;; Comments at the beginning of the line

(defun test (a &optional b)
  ;; Commends indented along with code
  (do-something a)                      ; Comments indented at column 40, or the last
  (do-something-else b))                ; column + 1 space if line exceeds 38 columns

Note: Emacs doesn't fontify #| |# very well, but as Rainer suggests in the comments, try using #|| ||# instead.
I'd say there are no rules to use this one, but I reckon it's faster for commenting huge amounts of code, or to insert some long description where the semicolons just get in the way of editing, like huge BNF listings or the like.
There's a neat trick to disable code which is to prefix an expression with #+(or):
(defun test (a &optional b)
  #+(or)
  (do-something a)
  (do-something-else b))

Note: #+nil usually works too, unless you happen to have a nil or :nil feature.  The advantage of #+(or) is that you can edit it easily by either commenting it out or change it to #+(and), or to actually include a set of features upon which you really want that expression to be read.
SLIME helps here by fontifying the form (do-something a) as a comment when you have a Lisp running.
Apart from Common Lisp's particular commenting syntax and tricks, such as #| |# and #+(or) or the more commonly seen #+nil, I believe the semicolon rules are widely adopted in other lisps too.

Here's an excerpt from the specification, note how current practice has diverged regarding the single semicolon:

2.4.4.2 Notes about Style for Semicolon
Some text editors make assumptions about desired indentation based on the number of semicolons that begin a comment. The following style conventions are common, although not by any means universal.
2.4.4.2.1 Use of Single Semicolon
Comments that begin with a single semicolon are all aligned to the same column at the right (sometimes called the “comment column”). The text of such a comment generally applies only to the line on which it appears. Occasionally two or three contain a single sentence together; this is sometimes indicated by indenting all but the first with an additional space (after the semicolon).
2.4.4.2.2 Use of Double Semicolon
Comments that begin with a double semicolon are all aligned to the same level of indentation as a form would be at that same position in the code. The text of such a comment usually describes the state of the program at the point where the comment occurs, the code which follows the comment, or both.
2.4.4.2.3 Use of Triple Semicolon
Comments that begin with a triple semicolon are all aligned to the left margin. Usually they are used prior to a definition or set of definitions, rather than within a definition.
2.4.4.2.4 Use of Quadruple Semicolon
Comments that begin with a quadruple semicolon are all aligned to the left margin, and generally contain only a short piece of text that serve as a title for the code which follows, and might be used in the header or footer of a program that prepares code for presentation as a hardcopy document.

",,"In Lisp, there is no strict convention about the number of semicolons for different kinds of comments or a specific level of indentation associated with them. However, the general practice is to use a single semicolon (`;`) followed by the comment text on the same line. This form of inline commenting is used extensively throughout code.

Regarding indentation and the placement of semicolons, it's more about readability and personal/team preferences rather than strict conventions. A common practice is to align comments with the preceding opening parenthesis for better readability, although this can vary based on coding standards adopted by different teams.

For multiline comments, which are represented by `#|` to start and `|#` to end in some implementations (like Common Lisp), there's no universal convention either, but they are typically used for longer explanations or when commenting out large blocks of code. Their usage is generally less frequent than inline semicolons due to the overhead of starting and ending them.

In summary, while there are established practices, the exact conventions can vary between different Lisp implementations and coding styles. It's recommended to consult specific documentation or community guidelines for the implementation you're using.",0.5368,[[0.58104664]],0.019222000519591748,0.12023205041014652,0.3006993006993007,0.05607476635514019,0.1282051282051282
"I just started learning Lisp and I am having trouble understanding what this code from Rosetta Code says:

(defun pascal (n)

       (print l)

I've been looking at some websites about lisp but it still confusing. The only programming language I know is Java. If someone could please explain in Java what the bold parts say, I would be grateful.
","Lisp uses prefix notation because things that are usually operators (ie +, -, >) in other languages are considered functions in Lisp.  (+ 1 1) in Lisp is equivalent to 1 + 1; in Java.  You could think of it as calling an add function with 1 and 1 as arguments: add(1, 1)  It just takes some getting used to.
So (> 2 (length l)) is equivalent to to 2 > length(l)
The ' in '(1) tells Lisp to treat what follows as a literal.  So instead of Lisp looking for a function called 1 (which is what would happen without the backtick) it returns a list containing 1 as an element.  An equivalent way of saying that in Lisp is (quote (1)) which returns the literal list containing 1.
",,"Certainly! Let's break down the Lisp code and translate it into equivalent concepts in Java.\n\n### `pascal` Function\nIn Lisp:\n```lisp\n(defun pascal (n)\n   (genrow n '(1)))\n```\n\nThis is a simple function that calls another function, `genrow`, with the argument `n` and an initial list `(1)`. In Java terms, it's like having a method call another method:\n```java\npublic void pascal(int n) {\n    genrow(n, new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1)));\n}\n```\n\n### `genrow` Function\nIn Lisp:\n```lisp\n(defun genrow (n l)\n   (when (< 0 n)\n       (print l)\n       (genrow (1- n) (cons 1 (newrow l)))))\n```\n\nThe function `genrow` is a recursive function that prints the current row and then calls itself with `n-1`. The argument list for this function includes `n` (which represents how many rows to generate) and `l` (the current row). It checks if `n` is greater than 0, and if so, it prints the current row (`l`) and generates the next row by calling another helper function, `newrow`, which adds a `1` at the beginning of the new row.\n\nIn Java:\n```java\npublic void genrow(int n, List<Integer> l) {\n    if (n > 0) {\n        System.out.println(l);\n        genrow(n - 1, new ArrayList<>(List.of(1).stream().collect(Collectors.toList()).addAll(newrow(l))));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### `newrow` Function\nIn Lisp:\n```lisp\n(defun newrow (l)\n   (if (> 2 (length l))\n      '(1)\n      (cons (+ (car l) (cadr l)) (newrow (cdr l)))))\n```\n\nThe function `newrow` generates the next row of Pascal's triangle given the current row. If the length of the list `l` is less than 3, it returns `(1)` as a single element. Otherwise, it adds together the first two elements and conses that sum with the result of calling itself on the rest of the list (excluding the first element).\n\nIn Java:\n```java\npublic List<Integer> newrow(List<Integer> l) {\n    if (l.size() < 3) {\n        return Collections.singletonList(1);\n    }\n    int sum = l.get(0) + l.get(1);\n    ArrayList<Integer> newRow = new ArrayList<>(newrow(l.subList(1, l.size())));\n    newRow.add(0, sum);\n    return newRow;\n}\n```\n\nThis should help you understand how the Lisp code works in a more familiar Java context.",0.5369,[[0.34054104]],0.07802467713297814,0.3371339936775553,0.2746615087040619,0.03495145631067961,0.1353965183752418

int y = myUnterminableNameFunction(x);

instead of
int x = myUnterminableNameFunction(someFunctionCall() ? someOtherFunctionCall() : 42);

This can be done in Lisp too, but as far as I'm aware, only by using let. let introduces an additional level of nesting, which I'd rather avoid.

",,"To achieve non-nesting variable declaration in Lisp similar to what you described, you can use a macro. A macro allows you to define syntax that gets expanded at compile time, which means you can effectively 'flatten' the expression without adding an extra layer of nesting. Here's an example of how you might implement `declare_local` using a macro:

```lisp
(defmacro declare_local (var value &body body)
  `(let ((,var ,value))
     ,@body))

(defun my_function (a b)
  (declare_local x (if (some-function-call) (some-other-function-call) 42))
  (my-unterminable-name-function x))
```

In this example, the `declare_local` macro expands to a `let` form that introduces the variable without nesting it directly in the function body. This should help reduce the nested appearance of your code while maintaining readability and performance.

Using macros like this is generally safe for performance because the Lisp compiler will expand the macro before generating machine code, meaning there's no runtime overhead associated with the macro expansion.",0.6187,[[0.18775279]],0.20338719921344728,0.35439713618677043,0.2647058823529412,0.05185185185185186,0.1323529411764706

(setq stuff (list `one `two `three (+ 2 2)))
stuff ; prints ""one two three 4""

The first setq creates a list ""one two three (+ 2 2)"".  The second list creates ""one two three 4"".  Why does the first list not evaluate the (+ 2 2), but the second one does?  I read in the Emacs Lisp intro documentation that when the list is built that it evaluates from the inside out.  Why doesn't the first list evaluate the addition before adding it to the list?
This is elisp in emacs 24.
","' is not equivalent to list, it's shorthand for quote. You're really doing this:
(setq stuff (quote (one two three (+ 2 2))))

The argument to quote is the expression (one two three (+ 2 2)).
From http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Quoting.html: ""The special form quote returns its single argument, as written, without evaluating it"".
",,"In Emacs Lisp (and Common Lisp), when you create a list using single quotes (i.e., '(one two three (+ 2 2))), it is quoted. Quoting means that the forms within the parentheses are not evaluated; instead, they are treated as symbols or literal values. Therefore, in your first example:

```lisp
(setq stuff '(one two three (+ 2 2)))
```

The list `stuff` contains four elements: the symbol `one`, the symbol `two`, the symbol `three`, and the unevaluated form `(+ 2 2)`. The addition operation `(+) 2 2` is not evaluated because it is part of a quoted list.

In your second example:

```lisp
(setq stuff (list 'one 'two 'three (+ 2 2)))
```

Here, you explicitly evaluate the addition using parentheses and `+`, so it is evaluated at the time the list is constructed. The result of `(+) 2 2` is `4`, which gets inserted into the list instead of the form itself.

To summarize, in the first case, the list contains a literal expression that is not evaluated, while in the second case, the addition is evaluated and its result (4) is included in the list.",0.5651,[[0.36907393]],0.12605545349951222,0.3530951728389177,0.2833333333333333,0.09243697478991596,0.17500000000000002

Basically, you are telling the interpreter (or compiler): take the result of the

and 
(mapcar #'car '((foo bar) (foo1 bar1)))

work as the same. 
And I also know ' means (quote symbol) and #' means (function function-name). 
But what's the underlying difference? Why these 2 both work in previous mapcar?
","'foo

evaluates to the symbol FOO.
#'foo

evaluates to the function bound to the name FOO.
In Lisp a symbol can be called as a function when the symbol FOO has a function binding. Here CAR is a symbol that has a function binding.
But this does not work:
(flet ((foo (a) (+ a 42)))
  (mapcar 'foo '(1 2 3 4 5)))

That's because FOO as a symbol does not access the local lexical function and the Lisp system will complain when foo is not a function defined elsewhere.
We need to write:
(flet ((foo (a) (+ a 42)))
  (mapcar #'foo '(1 2 3 4 5)))

Here the (function foo) or its shorthand notation #'foo refers to the lexical local function FOO.
Note also that in
(funcall #'foo ...)

vs.
(funcall 'foo ...)

The later might do one more indirection, since it needs to lookup the function from the symbol, while #'foo denotes the function directly.
Summary:
If a symbol has a function binding, calling a function through the symbol works.    
",,"In Lisp, both ' and #' are used for quoting, but they serve different purposes when used with function names. The single quote ' creates a quoted list, whereas #’ (or funcall) is a shorthand for applying the function function-name to its arguments.

In your example:

1. `(mapcar 'car '((foo bar) (foo1 bar1)))`

Here, 'car quotes the symbol `car` but does not evaluate it as a function immediately. It's essentially equivalent to writing `(mapcar #'car ...)` in this context because `car` is a special form that can be used directly without needing funcall.

2. `(mapcar #'car '((foo bar) (foo1 bar1)))`

In this case, #’ ensures that the symbol `car` is evaluated as a function before being passed to mapcar. This explicitly tells Lisp to treat `car` as a function rather than a symbol.

The reason both work in your example is because in most cases, when you pass a symbol to mapcar (or any function that expects a function), it's implicitly treated as the function associated with that symbol. However, using #’ makes this behavior explicit and can be useful for clarity or in more complex scenarios where symbols might not refer to functions.

In summary, both forms work because `car` is a standard Lisp function. The difference lies in explicitness and potential future-proofing of your code: always passing a function with #' makes it clear that you are referring to the function rather than just a symbol.",0.6223,[[0.53547518]],0.22183424859636838,0.398225910949904,0.4676616915422886,0.12,0.20398009950248758
"When one is programming in an imperative programming languages such as Java one can conveniently add trace statements. For example:
for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
  // do something
  // do something
  System.out.println(""Some trace statement"");
  // do something 
}

How does one accomplish this in a LISP dialect such as Clojure - for example say I wanted to add a trace just before recur:
(def fact
  (fn [n]
    (loop [cnt n acc 1]
       (if (zero? cnt)
            acc

The method should be relatively as simple as adding a line

","Non-invasive tracing
Lisp environments generally provide interactive debugging environment and trace mechanisms.
For example, in SBCL, you could use the trace macro:
you don't even need to modify your code, like you did in your Java example.
For Clojure, look at the tools.trace library, or the following answer: clojure: adding a debug trace to every function in a namespace?
Custom functions and macros
See also the many answers to this question: Debugging in Clojure?
Most of them involve nesting the expression you want to debug/trace inside another expression, like Chiron suggested.
I don't think that ""I have to reformat and close the brackets appropriately"" is a good argument; everytime you edit your program you have to deal with the syntax, or else you won't ever modify your code.
Paredit
I personally don't use I am now a happy user of Paredit. Your editor keep track of parens and brackets while you code, which is quite handy. 
Reader macros
I you really don't want to nest your expression inside another one, I suppose you could write a reader macro so that you could annotate an expression with a debug statement, but this is overkill, imho (edit: this is what spyscope does, apparently; see NielsK's answer).

(define 1-to-3 (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil))))

Is there a built-in way to insert an element at the end of a list (i.e., append it to the list)?
","Use append
There is no built-in way to add an item to the end of a list in standard Scheme. If this is something that you really need to do, but infrequently, you can use append:
;;; Using append: linear in the length of the list `xs`.
(define (append-item xs x)
  (append xs (list x)))

> (append-item '(1 2 3 4) 5)
(1 2 3 4 5)

Pick a Better Data Structure
If you need to add a lot of items to the ends of lists, append will become expensive since it has linear time complexity. The specific use case will guide your choices here; if the goal is to build a list from the end instead of from the front then it may be best to cons up the list and reverse it, as discussed by @Sylwester. If instead you need to be able to add and remove elements from both ends of a list, you might consider a double-ended queue. You can roll your own, or you may be able to use a preexisting library such as SRFI 117 or SRFI 134.
There is no way to get the last pair of a list without either walking the list, maintaining an index, or maintaining a pointer to the last pair of the list in Scheme. You can walk a list directly (but have linear time complexity); you can get constant time complexity by maintaining state (e.g., an index or tail pointer). When you start down this path, you will likely want to create some sort of data structure that abstracts the details. A deque is one example of such a data structure, but as @WillNess has observed, that may be more data structure than you need. A simpler data structure could be created, but the details would depend on an actual use case.
Mutation on a List
You can use mutation to add an element to the end of a list, but this is not idiomatic in Scheme, and it is probably a bad idea, anyway. (Although you might find mutation used in an implementation of a deque or similar data structure). You could mutate the last pair in the input list, using set-cdr! to attach a list containing the new element, like this:
;;; Using `set-cdr!`: this is still linear in the length of `xs`, since it
;;; requires `length`.
(define (append-item! xs x)
  (set-cdr! (list-tail xs (- (length xs) 1)) (list x))
  xs)

> (append-item! (list 1 2 3 4) 5)
(1 2 3 4 5)
> (append-item! (list 1 2 3 4) 5)
(1 2 3 4 5)
> (define xs (list 1 2 3 4))
> (append-item! xs 5)
(1 2 3 4 5)
> xs
(1 2 3 4 5)

This is a bad idea because: 1) you should not attempt to modify list literals in Scheme, which means that you have to pay attention to the provenance of lists given to append-item!, and 2) it is linear in the length of its input list anyway.
",,"Yes, there is a built-in way to append an element to the end of a list in Scheme. You can use the `append` function for this purpose. For example, if you have a list and want to add an element at the end, you can do something like this:

```lisp
(define my-list (list 1 2 3))
(append my-list '(4))
; (1 2 3 4)
```

Alternatively, if you prefer not to use `append`, you can define a recursive function to append an element to the end of a list. Here's an example:

```lisp
(define (my-append lst elem)
  (if (null? lst)
      (list elem)
      (cons (car lst) (my-append (cdr lst) elem))))

",,"The differences you're observing between `defun` and `lambda` definitions, along with their usage within functions like `mapcar`, primarily stem from how these forms are evaluated in Common Lisp. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Function Definitions**:\n   - When a function is defined using `defun`, the name of the function becomes a global symbol that can be directly called or passed around as an argument to other functions like `mapcar`. For example, `(g 3)` works because `g` is a globally recognized function.\n\n2. **Lambda Expressions**:\n   - A lambda expression (created with `lambda`) returns the actual anonymous function itself. This means that when you store a lambda in a variable and then call it via `funcall`, or pass it to another function like `mapcar`, you're dealing directly with the function object. For instance, `(setf f (lambda (x) (+ x x)))` assigns an anonymous function to `f`. When you then use `(funcall f 3)`, you are calling that specific lambda function.\n\nIn Common Lisp, the behavior of `mapcar` is consistent: it applies its first argument as a function to each element of the list provided in the second argument. The difference lies in how these functions are defined and accessed:\n- **With defun**: You can directly refer to the global symbol (e.g., `g`) within `mapcar`. For example, `(mapcar #'g '(1 2 3))` works because `#'g` is a shorthand for the global function object.\n- **With lambda**: Since you're dealing with an anonymous function stored in a variable (`f`), you need to explicitly use `funcall` or another similar mechanism to invoke it, as in `(funcall f 3)`.\n\nThis difference can be seen as more consistent when considering how Common Lisp treats functions and closures. The lambda form is more flexible for defining local functions or functions that are only needed within a specific context, whereas `defun` is more about creating globally accessible functions.",0.3785,[[0.10546543]],0.006016048582697925,0.09624639076034651,0.030211480362537763,0.0,0.030211480362537763
"I define square and sum-of-squares as:
(defun square(x)
  (* x x))
(defun sum-of-squares (x y)
  (+ (square x) (square y)))

then apply it an array with reduce:
(reduce 'sum-of-squares '(2 2 2))

but get result as 68 rather than 12.
What's the problem?
","The reduction does
(sum-of-squares (sum-of-squares 2 2) 2)

which is
    (sum-of-squares 8 2)

which is 64 + 4
You can get the result you expect with
(reduce #'+ (mapcar #'square '(2 2 2)))

or
(reduce #'(lambda (x y) (+ x (square y))) '(2 2 2) :initial-value 0)

or by defining sum-of-squares to take an arbitrary number of arguments.
",,"The issue lies in how you are applying the `reduce` function. The `reduce` function applies a binary function cumulatively to the items of an iterable from left to right so as to reduce the iterable to a single value. In your case, you want to sum the squares of all elements in the list `(2 2 2)`. However, when you use `(reduce 'sum-of-squares '(2 2 2))`, it treats `'(2 2 2)` as a single argument and applies `sum-of-squares` incorrectly. To fix this, you need to specify the function directly instead of using its symbol. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```lisp\n(reduce #'+ (map 'list #'square '(2 2 2)))\n```\nor simply:\n\n```lisp\n(reduce #'+ (mapcar #'square '(2 2 2)))\n```\nThis will correctly compute the sum of squares, resulting in `12`. Alternatively, you can directly use a loop or apply function to achieve the desired result.",0.6039,[[0.4822052]],0.17156906811380387,0.37687731230463345,0.3669724770642202,0.1574074074074074,0.2568807339449541
"This recursive definition of a macro does what it should (sum integers from 1 to n):
(defmacro sum-int-seq (n)
  `(cond
     ((equal 0 ,n) 0)
     (t (+ ,n (sum-int-seq (- ,n 1))))))

For example (sum-int-seq 5) gives 15.
But why does it work? When the macro gets expanded i get this:
(macroexpand '(sum-int-seq 5))
(IF (EQUAL 0 5) 0 (+ 5 (SUM-INT-SEQ (- 5 1))))

But because sum-int-seq is a macro the macro evaluation should become an infinite loop. Does the compiler create a recursive function instead? If this definition creates a recursive function is there any way to define macros recursively?
(This is a silly example for the sake of brevity, a function would of course work better for this)
","Your example does not work.
It may work in an interpreter. But with a compiler you'll see an endless loop during compilation.
CL-USER 23 > (defun test (foo)
                (sum-int-seq 5))
TEST

Let's use the LispWorks interpreter:
CL-USER 24 > (test :foo)
15

Let's try to compile the function:
CL-USER 25 > (compile 'test)

Stack overflow (stack size 15997).
  1 (continue) Extend stack by 50%.
  2 Extend stack by 300%.
  3 (abort) Return to level 0.
  4 Return to top loop level 0.

Type :b for backtrace or :c <option number> to proceed.
Type :bug-form ""<subject>"" for a bug report template or :? for other options.

So, now the next question: why does it work in the interpreter, but the compiler can't compile it?
Okay, I'll explain it.
Let's look at the interpreter first.

it sees (sum-int-seq 5).
it macroexpands it to (COND ((EQUAL 0 5) 0) (T (+ 5 (SUM-INT-SEQ (- 5 1))))).
it then evaluates above form. It determines that it needs to compute (+ 5 (SUM-INT-SEQ (- 5 1))). For that it needs to macroexpand (SUM-INT-SEQ (- 5 1)).
eventually it will expand into something like (cond ((EQUAL 0 (- (- (- (- (- 5 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)) 0) .... Which then will return 0 and the computation can use this result and add the other terms to it.

The interpreter takes the code, evaluates what it can and macroexpands if necessary. The generated code is then evaluated or macroexpanded. And so on.
Now let's look at the compiler.

it sees (sum-int-seq 5) and macroexpands it into (COND ((EQUAL 0 5) 0) (T (+ 5 (SUM-INT-SEQ (- 5 1))))).
now the macroexpansion will be done on the subforms, eventually.
the compiler will macroexpand (SUM-INT-SEQ (- 5 1)). note that the code never gets evaluated, only expanded.
the compiler will macroexpand (SUM-INT-SEQ (- (- 5 1) 1)) and so forth. finally you'll see a stack overflow.

The compiler walks (recursively compiles / expands) the code. It may not execute the code (unless it does optimizations or a macro actually evaluates it explicitly).
For a recursive macro you'll need to actually count down. If you eval inside the macro, then something like (sum-int-seq 5) can made work. But for (defun foo (n) (sum-int-seq n)) this is hopeless, since the compiler does not know what the value of n is.
",,"The provided macro works because macros are expanded at compile time, not run-time. When you call `(sum-int-seq 5)`, the macro is expanded into an equivalent form of code which is then evaluated as a function call in the run-time environment. The expansion does indeed look recursive when you see it printed with `macroexpand`, but this is because the macro itself is written recursively. However, once expanded, the resulting form is not a macro anymore—it's a regular function call that will be evaluated without further macro processing.\n\nIn other words, the macro system doesn't 'remember' or create a recursive function; it simply expands each invocation of `sum-int-seq` into a corresponding run-time expression. This expansion happens once, and then the resulting code is executed as normal Lisp code, which can be either recursive or not depending on how you write it.\n\nTo define macros recursively, you just need to ensure that their expansions also use recursion in a similar manner. However, keep in mind that the macro itself doesn't create a function; it generates a form of code that will be evaluated as part of your program.",0.5524,[[0.46610552]],0.060880686802825275,0.16856062972828179,0.3250414593698176,0.059900166389351084,0.14262023217247097
"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs has the following footnote:

Another way to define the selectors and constructor is
(define make-rat cons)
(define numer car)
(define denom cdr)
The first definition associates the name make-rat with the value of the expression cons, which is the primitive procedure that constructs pairs. Thus make-rat and cons are names for the same primitive constructor.
Defining selectors and constructors in this way is efficient: Instead of make-rat calling cons, make-rat is cons, so there is only one procedure called, not two, when make-rat is called. On the other hand, doing this defeats debugging aids that trace procedure calls or put breakpoints on procedure calls: You may want to watch make-rat being called, but you certainly don't want to watch every call to cons.

Does this advice still apply? For example, are modern debugging aids still defeated in this way?
","Quite often they will be.  For instance imagine some debugger which is trying to print a backtrace in a useful way.  It's going to want to map between the procedure objects sitting in the backtrace and their names.  And that map is either going to point at the 'wrong' name, or it's going to point at all the names and you then have to know which one you actually used.
Here's an example in Racket:
> (object-name cons)
'cons
> (define make-thingy cons)
> (object-name make-thingy)
'cons

",,"The advice provided in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) regarding the use of primitive procedures like `cons`, `car`, and `cdr` directly for defining constructors and selectors still holds relevance today, but the impact on debugging might vary depending on the specific debugging tools used. Modern debugging aids have evolved to handle such cases more effectively, often allowing users to set breakpoints or trace calls at a more granular level. However, in some simpler or less advanced debuggers, using primitive procedures for constructor and selector definitions could still make it harder to distinguish between direct calls to `cons` and indirect calls through custom-defined constructors like `make-rat`. Therefore, while modern debugging tools might provide better support, the advice still serves as a reminder of potential implications on code clarity and debugging experience.",0.4791,[[0.27539764]],0.056244735640032587,0.3073901577635707,0.2844444444444445,0.0,0.12444444444444445

",,"To achieve what you're describing, you can create a function that uses Emacs Lisp (Elisp) to accomplish the task. Here's how you can do it based on your existing macro definition in `.emacs`:

First, ensure your `next-id` macro is defined as shown. Then, define a new Elisp function that will perform the loop you described. Here’s an example of what this might look like:

"I am studying SICP and wrote two procedures to compute the sum of 1/n^2, the first generating a recursive process and the second generating an iterative process :
(define (sum-rec a b)
  (if (> a b)
      0
      (exact->inexact (+ (/ 1 (* a a)) (sum-rec (1+ a) b)))))

(define (sum-it a b)
  (define (sum_iter a tot)
    (if (> a b)
        tot
        (sum_iter (1+ a) (+ (/ 1 (* a a)) tot))))
  (exact->inexact (sum_iter a 0)))

I tested that both procedures give exactly the same results when called with small values of b, and that the result is approaching $pi^2/6$ as b gets larger, as expected.
But surprisingly, calling (sum-rec 1 250000) is almost instantaneous whereas calling (sum-it 1 250000) takes forever.
Is there an explanation for that? 
","As was mentioned in the comments, sum-it in its present form is adding numbers using exact arithmetic, which is slower than the inexact arithmetic being used in sum-rec. To do an equivalent comparison, this is how you should implement it:
(define (sum-it a b)
  (define (sum_iter a tot)
    (if (> a b)
        tot
        (sum_iter (1+ a) (+ (/ 1.0 (* a a)) tot))))
  (sum_iter a 0))

Notice that replacing the 1 with a 1.0 forces the interpreter to use inexact arithmetic. Now this will return immediately:

=> 1.6449300668562465

",,"The significant difference in performance between the recursive and iterative procedures is due to how they handle stack space. The recursive procedure (sum-rec) creates a new stack frame for each call to `sum-rec`, leading to increased memory usage as `a` increases, which can quickly lead to a stack overflow if `b` is very large. In contrast, the iterative procedure (sum-it) uses constant space because it doesn't create new stack frames with each recursive call; instead, it updates the accumulator (`tot`) and continues in a loop until the condition `(> a b)` is met. This means that the iterative version does not suffer from the same memory constraints as the recursive version when `b` is large.",0.5048,[[0.36370722]],0.14003789330842384,0.32373351007623696,0.35514018691588783,0.028301886792452827,0.16822429906542055

","You can't define top-level bindings outside of the top-level, in Scheme. (And inside of a let is definitely outside of the top-level---what you had, instead, was internal definitions, which are not exported to the top-level.) However, using define-values, you can still do what you need to do:

Despite it being defined within the inner `let`, its value persists across multiple invocations of the function. This is because the value of `state` is not redefined to '(() .

The outer `let` is used to define and initialize the `state` variable with a list containing two cons cells: a pair where the car is `()` (an empty list) and the cdr contains the initial list of elements to generate. The inner `let` then destructures this state, retrieving the first element from the generated list (using `(cadr state)`), and updates the state by removing that element from the list (using `(rplacd state (cddr state))`).

This pattern allows the function to remember its previous state between calls, thus generating one element at a time.

1. **First Version Issue**: In the `(odd? n)` case, your code includes an extra recursive call:
   ```scheme
   (pow (pow b (/ (- n 1) 2)) 2)

   This is not necessary and can lead to stack overflow for large `n`.

2. **Second Version Issue**: While it avoids the unnecessary additional calls, the way you handle odd numbers still leads to repeated calculations that could be optimized.

I just use the library's official documentation, or quickdocs as mentioned earlier. I don't think there are any comparison tables between similar libraries.

"I'm relatively new to Lisp (I just know the very basics) and I'm currently trying to run an algorithmic composition program created by David Cope. It runs in MCL 5.0, and I keep getting the following error:

Error in process play: Stack overflow on value stack.
  To globally increase stack space, increase *minimum-stack-overflow-size*

Does anyone know what function I would use to increase the stack overflow size and how I would calculate the best stack overflow size for my computer? I'm running MCL on an old Powerbook with 512 MB of RAM.
Thanks for your time,
Eddie
","It seems to say that you simply need to modify the special variable *minimum-stack-overflow-size*.  When you are at the REPL (CL-USER> prompt or similar), inspect this variable by evaluating its name:
CL-USER> *minimum-stack-overflow-size*

Then, set it to a bigger value (the 1234567 is just a placeholder) with setf:
CL-USER> (setf *minimum-stack-overflow-size* 1234567)

However, this might not be the real issue.  I do not know MCL well, but it might be necessary to (declaim (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0))) or similar to enable tail call elimination, if the program you want to run uses a tail recursive function which depends on such optimization.
",,"The error you are encountering is due to the program exceeding the maximum stack size available. In MCL 5.0, you can increase the minimum stack overflow size by setting the variable `*minimum-stack-overflow-size*` in your Lisp code.

To do this, add the following line at the beginning of your program or interactively within the environment:

```lisp
(setq *minimum-stack-overflow-size* 16777216) ; This sets it to 16 MB
```

You can increase this value as needed. However, setting it too high may lead to excessive memory usage, which could be problematic on your old Powerbook with only 512MB of RAM.

To determine the appropriate size for your specific situation, consider:

1. Analyze the program's behavior and identify where the stack overflow occurs.
2. Gradually increase the value while monitoring system performance and memory usage.
3. Test different sizes to find a balance between avoiding stack overflows and managing available resources efficiently.

Given your limited RAM (512MB), starting with a lower value like 8 MB or even less, then incrementally increasing it, might be more practical. For instance:

```lisp
(setq *minimum-stack-overflow-size* 8388608) ; This sets it to 8 MB

"I think I understand Lisp macros and their role in the compilation phase.
But in Python, you can pass a function into another function
def f(filename, g):
  try:                                
     fh = open(filename, ""rb"") 
     g(fh)
  finally:
     close(fh) 

So, we get lazy evaluation here. What can I do with macros and not with functions as first class objects?
","First of all Lisp has first-class functions too, so you could as well ask: ""Why do I need macros in Lisp if I already have first-class functions"". The answer to that is that first-class functions don't allow you to play with syntax.
On a cosmetic level, first-class functions allow you to write f(filename, some_function) or f(filename, lambda fh: fh.whatever(x)), but not f(filename, fh, fh.whatever(x)). Though arguably that's a good thing because in that last case it is a lot less clear where fh suddenly comes from.
More importantly functions can only contain code that is valid. So you can't write a higher-order function reverse_function that takes a function as an argument and executes it ""in reverse"", so that reverse_function(lambda: ""hello world"" print) would execute print ""hello world"". With a macro you can do this. Of course this particular example is quite silly, but this ability is enormously useful when embedding domain specific languages.
For example you couldn't implement common lisp's loop construct in python. Hell, you couldn't even implement python's for ... in construct in python if it wasn't really built-in - at least not with that syntax. Sure you could implement something like for(collection, function), but that's a lot less pretty.
",,"While Python supports passing functions around as first-class objects, Lisp's macros provide a different level of power by allowing you to transform code at compile-time. With macros, you can modify the syntax and semantics of the language itself in a way that is not possible with functions alone. For example, you can create domain-specific languages (DSLs) within your Lisp programs or automatically generate boilerplate code. This kind of code transformation happens before the program is actually compiled to machine code, making macros a powerful tool for code generation and manipulation.",0.542,[[0.35871429]],0.05188573939084834,0.164228003741528,0.2803738317757009,0.07523510971786833,0.14330218068535827
"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)'s box-and-pointer diagrams in Figures 3.16 and 3.17 don't appear equivalent (purely with respect to value, not memory) even though it says they are. (""When thought of as a list, z1 and z2 both represent ""the same"" list, ((a b) a b))"", pg. 258)
(define x (list 'a 'b))
(define z1 (cons x x))
(define z2 (cons (list 'a 'b) (list 'a 'b)))

SICP diagrams the pair z1 like this:

and z2 like this:

The arrows in the pair, z1, don't both seem to be pointing to the entire pair, x. They don't even point to the same thing, despite both having received the same (memory and value) pair.
I would evaluate the first diagram as (a b), and the second as ((a b) a b)
I could guess that each arrow is actually pointing to the entire pair, x, but in figure 2.3 on page 98:

it very clearly points to an entire box by either pointing to the side or in between two items.
Am I understanding box-and-pointer diagrams incorrectly or something else entirely?
","Your last assumption is correct. The dot indicates where the pointer value is, the whole double box the arrow is pointing at is the target. It doesn't matter if it's pointing on the side, top middle, top left or top right. It's the whole pair that is the ""address"" of the object. 
You can't point to a part of an object without accessing its part with car and cdr. The second you do that you have whatever it was pointed to and not a indirect pointer. (car '(a b)) ; ==> a and a doesn't have any essence of the list that still is pointing to it until it is garbage collected. 
We could illustrate it like this instead: 
[=#1|#3|#2]
[=#2|#3|()] 
[=#3|a |#4]
[=#4|b |()]

The first value with =# is the location of the box itself, while the next two are car and cdr. Above, x points to the address #3 and z1 to #1. Let's make z2
[=#5|#6|#8]
[=#6|a |#7] 
[=#7|b |()] 
[=#8|#9|()]
[=#9|a |#10]
[=#10|b |()]

As you can see, z2 uses two more cons than z1 since it doesn't reuse the same object as both elements of its list, but uses individual similar-looking lists. 
In the drawings, both car and cdr of z1 point to the same list x. z2 points to two different lists, but the elements in those lists are the same.  
The reason for this is that symbols are singletons. Thus, you only have one symbol object for a and evaluating 'a in two different places will both point to the same a.  Other singletons are #f, #t and ()
cons always creates a fresh pair and list is just a procedure that cons together the arguments. Thus the same code (list 'a 'b) two places in the expression makes two different objects that just look the same.
(eq? (car z1) (cdr z1))    ; ==> #t same object
(eq? (car z2) (cdr z2))    ; ==> #f not same object
(equal? (car z2) (cdr z2)) ; ==> #t they look the same, but they are not the same. (created at different places)

Quoted data can be seen as created all at once before the program starts. Thus this is undefined.
(eq? '(a b) '(a b))         ; ==> #t or #f (undefined)
(eq? '(b c) (cdr '(a b c))) ; ==> #t or #f (undefined)

The reason is that Scheme is allowed, but not obligated, to reuse data the same way as with the structure z1.

"In Racket, it's possible to make a copy of a struct with particular fields changed. The following:

  (struct-copy foo somefoo [param 4]))

Then I receive the error struct-copy: accessor name not associated with the given structure type. Because it's treating 'param' as an accessor, rather than evaluating it and treating the symbol/string inside as an accessor.
So I was wondering, is it possible to use struct-copy where the intended field name is known only at runtime? And if not, is there a workaround of some sort, or should I just bite the bullet and change foo to a mutable struct (as set-foo-a! and the like exist at runtime)?
","(This was originally a comment, but OP asked me to post it as an answer)
If you want to have arbitrary runtime field names, then it sounds like you're duck-typing a dictionary not a struct... in which case you should use a dictionary.
One characteristic of a Racket struct is that referencing a field can be faster precisely because it's a static offset known at compile time. Another characteristic is that you can't add a field unknown at compile time, or, omit a field.
When those characteristics are advantages (i.e. when you don't want to add or omit fields accidentally), you should use a struct. Otherwise (i.e. when you do want to add or omit fields intentionally -- which sounds like your situation) you should probably instead use some sort of dictionary, e.g. a hash-table or association list.
",,"In Racket, `struct-copy` requires that the field names be known at compile time. However, you can achieve similar functionality by using a different approach. One workaround is to use a dictionary (hash table) to store the field names and values that need to be updated. Here's an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```racket\n(define (update-foo somefoo param-value-pairs)\n  (let ((new-struct (apply struct-copy foo somefoo)))\n    (for ([pair param-value-pairs])\n      (match-define (list key value) pair)\n      (vector-set! new-struct (- (struct-field-count foo) (add1 key)) value))\n    new-struct))\n\n(define tst (foo 1 2 3))\n(update-foo tst '((a . 4) (b . 5))) ; Produces (foo 4 5 3)\n```\nIn this example, `param-value-pairs` is a list of pairs where each pair contains the field name and the new value. The `match-define` form extracts the key and value from each pair, and `vector-set!` updates the struct fields accordingly.\n\nThis approach allows you to modify fields based on runtime information without needing mutable structs.",0.5096,[[0.21720873]],0.12212280593910659,0.32860240480546565,0.28313253012048195,0.06060606060606061,0.13253012048192772

    r))

",,"Yes, it is possible to collect the results of a `map` operation into a 2-dimensional array (array with two dimensions) in Common Lisp. The issue you're encountering might be due to the incorrect use of `map`. In Common Lisp, `map` typically maps over lists and other sequences but does not directly create multi-dimensional arrays.

To achieve this, you can use a combination of `mapcar` or `loop` along with array creation functions like `make-array`. Here’s an example:

```lisp
(defun somefunction (element)
  ;; Your function logic here
  element)

(let ((result-array (make-array '(3 3) :initial-element nil)))
  (dotimes (i (array-total-size result-array))
    (setf (row-major-aref result-array i)
          (funcall #'somefunction (nth i some-sequence))))
  result-array)
```

In the above example, `make-array` is used to create a 3x3 array initialized with `nil`. Then, using `dotimes`, we iterate over each index in the array and set the corresponding element by calling `somefunction`.

Alternatively, you can use `loop`:

```lisp
(defun somefunction (element)
  ;; Your function logic here
  element)

(let ((result-array (make-array '(3 3) :initial-element nil)))
  (loop for i below (array-total-size result-array) do
        (setf (row-major-aref result-array i)
              (funcall #'somefunction (nth i some-sequence))))
  result-array)
```

In both cases, `result-array` will be a 2D array populated with the results of applying `somefunction` to each element in `some-sequence`.

To reference this array inside your function, you can use `(row-major-aref my-array index)` where `index` is the linear index based on the array's dimensions.",0.6407,[[0.62904297]],0.2218783115291253,0.4974239560444938,0.37135278514588854,0.08533333333333333,0.1803713527851459

","For Common Lisp it's a bit complicated, since implementations can use interpreted code, compiled code and heavily optimized compiled code.
Function calling in simple compiled code
For example SBCL by default compiles all code. Even the code entered via a read-eval-print-loop:
* (defun foo (a) (bar (1+ a)))
; in: DEFUN FOO
;     (BAR (1+ A))
;
; caught STYLE-WARNING:
;   undefined function: COMMON-LISP-USER::BAR
;
; compilation unit finished
;   Undefined function:
;     BAR
;   caught 1 STYLE-WARNING condition
FOO

Since the function gets compiled immediately, the compiler sees that there is an undefined function. But it's just a warning and not an error. The generated code will call the function bar, even if it is defined later.
Symbols have a function value
In Common Lisp the function objects for global functions are registered as symbols.
* (fboundp 'foo)
T
* (fboundp 'bar)
NIL

bar has no function definition. If we later define a function for bar, then the code of our earlier defined function foo will call this new function.
How does it work? The code in foo does a lookup at runtime to get the function value of the symbol bar and calls that function.
Thus we can also redefine bar and foo will call the new function.
Late Binding
The concept of doing runtime lookup of functions is often called late binding. This was described for Lisp in the 1960s.
Thus a call of a global function
(bar 1 a)

is conceptionally basically the same as
(if (fbound 'bar)
    (funcall (symbol-function 'bar) 1 a)
    (error ""undefined function BAR""))

Keep in mind that this is a simplistic model and in reality a Common Lisp file compiler may use more aggressive optimizations (like inlining), where there is no runtime lookup.
The evaluation of function forms
The Common Lisp standard says in Conses as Forms:

If the operator is neither a special operator nor a macro name, it is assumed to be a function name (even if there is no definition for such a function).

",,"In Racket, which is a dialect of Lisp, the order of top-level declarations does not matter because the evaluation of top-level forms is typically done after all source files have been read. This means that definitions are available in the global environment when functions try to call them, regardless of their declaration order. The behavior you observed with `function-defined-early` and `function-defined-later` is due to this deferred evaluation.

However, it's worth noting that the actual implementation details can vary between different Lisp dialects. In Common Lisp, as shown in your example, the order of definitions does matter because functions are looked up at the time they are called, and if a function has not been defined by that point, you will get an error.

For more detailed information on this topic, you can refer to Racket's documentation on top-level forms and evaluation.

","You can kill any thread. There is nothing special about it. If you get a list of threads, just get the thread you want to kill and pass it to the function.
The function destroy-thread does not see a variable. Since it is a function, Lisp uses the usual evaluation rules. It gets passed a thread. The thread just happens to be the value of a variable in your example.
It could be the value of a function call:
(defun my-thread ()

(bt:destroy-thread (my-thread))

or even part of a data structure, for example a list:
(defun my-thread ()
  (list 1 *foo* 3))

the question requires me to use iterative method rather than recursive method to deal with this problem, my thinking is following:

 begin: 2     3     1
 1    : 1     6     1

Obviously, in step 2, a equals 6/0. That should be impossible. But the function works well. Could anyone explain this? Here is the example in an online Scheme interpreter.
","No, the function doesn't work well. Copy a fresh definition of the procedure, run it again and you'll see the error:

  (cond ((= b 0) n)
        ((even? b)
         (iter (/ b 2) (* 2 a) n))
        (else
         (iter (- b 1) (/ (* a b) (- b 1)) (+ a (* a (- b 1)))))))

(define (mul b a)
  (iter b a 1))

(mul 2 3)
=> /: division by zero

In fact, the expected solution would be more along these lines, and notice that special care must be taken in case that b is negative:
(define (iter a b n)
  (cond ((zero? b) n)
        ((even? b)
         (iter (+ a a) (/ b 2) n))
        (else

(define (mul a b)
  (if (< b 0)
      (- (iter a (- b) 0))
      (iter a b 0)))

        a     b     n

You were incorrectly surrounding some expressions between parenthesis, and some parenthesis were missing from the cond expression.

I want it works (+ (+ 2 2) (+ 3 2) (+ 4 2)) but loop collect give me the weird answer. 
Why does it work like this? Do I have some methods to fix this?
","If you want a freshly consed list, then copy-list is a way:

Nested backquote expressions are also possible:
(defmacro sigma ((op arg0 &rest args) ll)
  (declare (ignore arg0))
  `(+ ,@(loop for i in ll collect `(,op ,i ,@args))))

",,"The issue with your code lies in how you are using `loop` and `progn`. The `progn` form is evaluating all its forms immediately, which means the value of `(elt exp 1)` is set to each element in `ll`, but this change is not being captured correctly within the generated list. Instead, you should use a more appropriate way to generate the list of expressions that will be summed. Here's how you can fix it:

```lisp
(defmacro sigma (exp ll)
  `(apply #'+ (mapcar (lambda (i) (copy-tree ,exp)) ,ll)))
```

This version uses `mapcar` to create a new copy of the expression for each element in `ll`, ensuring that the original `exp` is not modified. The result is then passed to `apply #'+` to sum them up.

Let's break it down:
- `(lambda (i) (copy-tree ,exp))`: This lambda function creates a copy of the original `exp` for each element `i` in `ll`.
- `(mapcar ... ,ll)`: This applies the lambda function to each element in `ll`, generating a list of expressions.
- `(apply #'+ ...)`: Finally, this sums up all the generated expressions.

Try running the following code:

```lisp
(pprint (macroexpand-1 '(sigma (+ 1 2) (2 3 4))))
;; Should expand to something like: (+ (+ 1 2) (+ 1 3) (+ 1 4))

(sigma (+ 1 2) (2 3 4))

In MIT Scheme, both `runtime` and `system-clock` do indeed return the amount of process time elapsed since the scheme interpreter was started, but with some nuances:

1. **Precision**: The values returned by these functions (e.g., 0.1 seconds) are floating-point numbers representing fractional seconds. It's not uncommon for them to return small positive values like `0.01` even if no significant time has passed in your session.

2. **Interpreting Results**: If you're consistently seeing `.01`, it might be because of the precision and inherent timing mechanisms within MIT Scheme. This doesn't necessarily indicate a bug or misbehavior but rather reflects how the underlying system measures elapsed time.

3. **Environment Considerations**: Ensure that there's no other process or context in your environment that could be affecting these measurements (e.g., garbage collection, I/O operations).

Given the version of MIT-Scheme you're using (`Release 9.1.1`), it appears to be functioning as expected by returning a small non-zero value indicating some minimal elapsed time even if no significant external events have occurred.

then calling (change-value *x*). If I understand correctly, varname takes local scope and therefore the setf has no effect outside change-value. So, *x* remains as 10 afterwards.
My question is, is there a way to make *x* equal to 20 through a function call similar to the above? I tried adding (proclaim '(special varname)) and (declare (special varname)) and they don't seem to do anything.
Oh, and defining a macro does more or less what I want, but I doubt this is good practice:

So, what the function does is modify the local binding of the variable varname, changing it from 10 to 20 and returning the latter.
You need to pass the symbol (variable name) itself:
(defun change-value (varname)
  (setf (symbol-value varname) 20))

and call it as (change-value '*x*) (note the quote mark ' before *x*).
",,"In Common Lisp, you are correct that using `let` or other lexical binding forms like `lambda` will make variables local within those scopes. However, dynamic scoping can be achieved by marking a variable as special with `(proclaim '(special varname))` or `(declare (special varname))`. It seems you encountered an issue where these declarations did not have the expected effect. This could be due to the fact that `*x*` is already bound in lexical scope when your function tries to access it.

To ensure dynamic scoping, you should use special variables explicitly by referencing them with a leading asterisk (`*`) inside the function as well. Here’s how you can modify your code:

How can I check for and optimize runtime?
Is recursion any different in runtime than iteration?
Thank you for your answer!
Kind regards,
","There is one main thing that will improve the performance greatly, taking it from exponential to linear time.
Don't re-compute the recursion, save it as an intermediate result.
In the inner cond expression, (maximum (rest x)) is computed twice. Once in the question of the first branch, and once is the answer of the second branch.
(cond
  [(>= (first x) (maximum (rest x))) (first x)]
  [else (maximum (rest x))])

In the common case where the first question is false, (maximum (rest x)) will be re-computed, doubling the work it has to do. Even worse, this doubling can potentially happen at every level of recursion in the worst case when the max is at the end. This is what makes it exponential.
To fix this, you can use local to define and name the intermediate result.
(local [(define maxrst (maximum (rest x)))]
  (cond
    [(>= (first x) maxrst) (first x)]
    [else maxrst]))

This takes the big-O complexity from exponential to linear in the length of the input.
There are other potential optimizations such as taking advantage of tail-calls, but those aren't as important as saving the intermediate result to avoid re-computing the recursion.
This method of improving performance using local definitions is also described in How to Design Programs 2e Figure 100: Using local to improve performance.
",,"To check and potentially optimize the runtime of your function, let's first address a few issues with the provided code. The function `maximum` does not correctly handle lists that are not purely numeric or may contain non-numeric values. Moreover, using recursion for this purpose can be less efficient due to potential stack overflow risks with large input sizes.

Here is an improved version of your function:

```lisp
(define (maximum x)
  (cond
    [(empty? x) '()] ; Return '() instead of 0 to indicate no elements.
    [else (foldr max (first x) x)])) ; Use foldr for a more efficient approach.

;; Example usage:
(check-expect (maximum '(1 2 3)) 3)
(check-expect (maximum '(1)) 1)
(check-expect (maximum '()) '())
```

### Runtime Optimization

To optimize the runtime, consider using iterative solutions or built-in functions where available. In this case, `foldr` is used to traverse the list once, making it more efficient than a recursive approach.

### Recursion vs Iteration in Lisp

- **Recursion**: Recursive functions are powerful but can lead to stack overflow with very deep recursions (large input sizes). They are also generally less space-efficient.
  
- **Iteration**: Using iterative constructs like loops or built-in functions such as `foldr`, `map`, and `reduce` is often more efficient in terms of both time and space. These constructs help avoid the overhead associated with recursive function calls.

In summary, while recursion can be elegant, for this specific problem, an iterative approach using a built-in function like `foldr` provides better runtime performance.",0.5756,[[0.37538247]],0.18735917206834224,0.38642686231549817,0.3253796095444686,0.02178649237472767,0.1475054229934924

",,"To get started with Lisp, you should first choose a dialect of Lisp such as Common Lisp or Scheme. Next, install a development environment that supports your chosen Lisp dialect. For example, for Common Lisp, you might use SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) and Slime ( Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs). For Scheme, Racket is a popular choice with built-in tools.

","One way is:
(defstruct (person

  real-name

You can essentially tailor the constructor function to your needs, including

providing a different name than make-xxx
having Lisp generate a ""by-order-of-arguments"" (BOA) constructor instead of a keyword-based one

Consider 
(defstruct (person 
             (:constructor make-person (real-name
                                        &optional (fake-name real-name))))
    real-name
    fake-name)

You can even initialize constructed fields using the &aux lambda-list keyword:
(defstruct (person
             (:constructor make-person (real-name
                                        &aux (fake-name (format nil

            templist (if condition3 (conj templist {:somekey2 someval2}) templist)]
        (recur (+ x 1) (concat retur templist)))
      retur)))

which can then be tested:
 user> (myfunc 0 1 2 #(< % 5) true true)
 ({:somekey2 2} {:somekey1 1} {:somekey2 2} {:somekey1 1} {:somekey2 2} 
  {:somekey1 1} {:somekey2 2} {:somekey1 1} {:somekey2 2} {:somekey1 1})

user> (myfunc 0 1 2 #(< % 5) true false)
({:somekey1 1} {:somekey1 1} {:somekey1 1} {:somekey1 1} {:somekey1 1})

The idea in the let is to have each stage change the value if the condition is true, or return it unchanged if the condition is false. This pattern gives functional code an imperative look and can help to make it clear how a value is constructed, though it can also be taken too far in using it to ""convert"" imperative logic into a functional program.
",,"In Clojure, you cannot rebind a `let` binding within its scope, but you can achieve your goal by using nested sequences of `let` or by using a different approach such as a local mutable structure. However, to avoid global variables and stick with immutable data structures, you can use a combination of `loop/recur` and `concat` in a more controlled manner. Here is an example of how you could do this:\n\n```clojure\n(defn myfunc [x]\n  (loop [x x retur []]\n    (when condition1\n      (let [templist []]\n        (if condition2\n          (conj templist {:somekey someval}))\n        (if condition3\n          (conj templist {:somekey someval}))\n        (recur (+ x 1) (concat retur (vec templist)))))))\n```\n\nIn this code, `templist` is initialized as an empty vector and then modified using `conj`. After modifying it, the new list is concatenated to `retur` before proceeding with the next iteration. Note that I used `(vec templist)` when concatenating because `concat` expects collections, and vectors are more efficient for this purpose than lists.",0.6419,[[0.34830912]],0.2560867128245522,0.29223087591318436,0.35263157894736846,0.08465608465608467,0.2157894736842105

","string-append does not alter an existing string; it returns a new string that is the result of the operation.
If this seems unusual, consider the addition operator, +. When I write

So, in your case, if you write

To advise you further, it might help to know where you're heading with this.
",,"The issue you're encountering is due to the behavior of `string-append` in Scheme/Lisp. `string-append` does not modify a string in place; instead, it returns a new string that is the concatenation of its arguments. Therefore, each call to `(string-append ...)` creates a new string and discards the previous one unless you store the result back into a variable. In your first example, the results are being displayed individually because `display` is showing the intermediate results, but `myString` remains unchanged.

To achieve the desired behavior of accumulating strings, you need to use a mutable structure or another function that can modify the string in place. Here’s how you can do it using `string-append!`, which modifies a string:

But I'd like to know why Lisps have this restriction, and what negative consequences allowing this would have.  Are they any major dialects that do allow that?
","It makes evaluation more complicated and compilation hard.
If you have a form (a b c), then you need to resolve at runtime the value of a and then apply it somehow to the forms b and c.
The simpler model of a few limited number of special forms and otherwise strict evaluation is then gone.
See also: FEXPR
",,"The restriction on passing special forms directly as arguments or saving them in variables is a design choice made in Lisp and its dialects like Clojure, Racket/Scheme. This is primarily due to the way these languages handle evaluation and hygiene.

In Lisp, expressions are evaluated according to their form. Special forms have specific syntax and do not follow the same rules as other procedures. Allowing special forms to be passed around or stored would lead to potential issues with evaluation order, scoping, and hygiene of macros.

For example, if a special form like `if` were passed as a parameter and then evaluated in an unexpected context, it could lead to errors or incorrect behavior. This is because the `if` form has its own syntax for handling conditions and branches, which would be disrupted if treated as a regular function.

If you wrap a special form into a regular procedure, you encapsulate its evaluation within that procedure's scope, ensuring correct behavior:

```lisp
(define (my-if predicate true-val false-val)
  (if predicate true-val false-val))

(my-if #t 1 0) ; Evaluates to 1
```

In terms of negative consequences:
- **Evaluation Order**: Special forms often have specific evaluation rules. Passing them around could lead to unexpected order of operations.
- **Scoping Issues**: The context in which a special form is evaluated can significantly affect its behavior, making it difficult to manage if the form is not in a well-defined environment.
- **Hygiene Problems**: Macros and special forms rely on lexical scoping and hygiene. Allowing them as first-class values could disrupt this.

There are no major dialects of Lisp that allow passing special forms directly as arguments or saving them in variables without encapsulation, as this would generally violate the language's design principles for handling evaluation and macro expansion.",0.5001,[[0.36418649]],0.05161842418965814,0.2777777777777778,0.17877094972067037,0.028089887640449437,0.11173184357541899

","The structure of a do loop is:
(do ((var init-form step-form))
    (termination-form result-form)
  (body))

I think what you're missing is that step-form is  executed at every iteration and the result of this form is set to the variable.  So using setq in the step-form is a flag that you're probably not doing what you intend.
So the sequence of the loop from (test '(2 3 4)) is (eliding the print)
 - Initialize l to nil
 - Check (null y) which is false since y = '(2 3 4).
 - (setq l (append l '(1 1))) l now has the value '(1 1)
 - Execute the step form, this sets y = '(3 4) _and_ l = '(3 4)
 - (null y) still false.
 -  (setq l (append l '(1 1))) sets l = '(3 4 1 1)
 - Execute step form, sets y = '(4) _and_ l = '(4)
 - (setq l (append l '(1 1))) sets l = '(4 1 1)
 - Execute step form, y = () so loop terminates.

",,"The `do` loop in your code is designed to process a list by repeatedly taking its rest (i.e., all but the first element) until it reaches null. The line `(setq y (rest y))` updates the value of `y` within each iteration, which means that on each step, `y` becomes shorter and eventually becomes null.

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in your code regarding how lists are being manipulated. The `do` loop is intended to modify `y`, but the assignment `(setq y (rest y))` does not affect the outer scope's `y`. Instead, it modifies the local variable used within the loop. 

The line `(setq l (append l '(1 1)))` appends the list `(1 1)` to `l` in each iteration, which is why you see `(1 1)`, `(1 1)`, ... printed.

To clarify, the `do` loop is correctly setting up a new value for `y` (its rest), but it doesn't change what happens outside of this loop.

"I have an application I wrote in PHP (on symfony) that imports large CSV files (up to 100,000 lines). It has a real memory usage problem. Once it gets through about 15,000 rows, it grinds to a halt.
I know there are measures I could take within PHP but I'm kind of done with PHP, anyway.
If I wanted to write an app that imports CSV files, do you think there would be any significant difference between Ruby and Python? Is either one of them geared to more import-related tasks? I realize I'm asking a question based on very little information. Feel free to ask me to clarify things, or just speak really generally.
If it makes any difference, I really like Lisp and I would prefer the Lispier of the two languages, if possible.
","What are you importing the CSV file into? Couldn't you parse the CSV file in a way that doesn't load the whole thing into memory at once (i.e. work with one line at a time)?
If so, then you can use Python's standard csv library to do something like the following
import csv
with open('csvfile.csv', 'rb') as source:
    rdr= csv.reader( source )
    for row in rdr:
        # do whatever with row

Now don't take this answer as an immediate reason to switch to Python. I'd be very surprised if PHP didn't have a similar functionality in its CSV library, etc.
",,"When considering a transition from PHP to either Ruby or Python for handling large CSV files, both Ruby and Python are excellent choices. However, there might be some differences in their ecosystems and tools that could impact performance and ease of use.

Both languages have libraries specifically designed for working with CSV data. For instance, Python has `csv` (built-in), `pandas`, and `csvkit`, while Ruby offers gems like `fast_csv`, `roo`, and `csv`. Given your preference for Lisp and the fact that you are familiar with it, you might find Scheme or Common Lisp more appealing. However, direct comparisons between Ruby and Python in this context would not show a significant difference in performance unless specific libraries are compared.

In terms of memory management, both Ruby and Python can handle large datasets efficiently with proper use of libraries and data structures. For example, using `pandas` in Python or `dataframes` in R (which shares similarities with Scheme/Lisp) could be beneficial for handling CSV files. 

If you lean towards Lisp, consider looking at Clojure, which is a dialect of Lisp that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This can leverage JVM optimizations and has strong libraries for working with data. Alternatively, if you want to stick closer to Scheme or Common Lisp, there are projects like `Quicklisp` in Common Lisp that provide extensive support for various tasks, including CSV processing.

"In SICP lecture 2a, I'm confused on (average (f x) x). Can it not just be (average f x). Doesn't f mean the lambda of (/ x y) already? Why do I need (average (f x) x)?  Could someone help me out with the substitution method for this?

        1))

(define average-damp
    (λ (f)
        (λ (x) (average (f x) x))))

","This snippet:
(average (f x) x)

Means a different thing than this:
(average (f) x)

For starters, f is a function that expects a single parameter, which in this case must be x, hence we say (f x) . If you write (f) you're trying to call f with no parameters, resulting in an error. Substituting in average-damp after calling it with a value for the f parameter we discover that it returns another lambda, which is:
(λ (x)
  (average ((λ (y) (/ x y)) x) x))

As you can see, in this expression ((λ (y) (/ x y)) x), x is passed as a parameter to (λ (y) (/ x y)) x) (which was f), and x binds to the y parameter. Don't get confused! because now we have:
(/ x x)

But the first x at this point is not a variable, it's the value that was captured in a closure when calling sqrt, whereas the second x is the parameter in the lambda that we just returned, and is still unbound until the point where it gets called, presumably in fixed-point.
",,"In the context of the `sqrt` function and its use of `average-damp`, the expression `(average (f x) x)` is necessary because `f` is a procedure that takes a single argument. The `average-damp` function expects another function `f` as an argument, which it then applies to `x` and averages with `x`. This two-step process allows for the iterative improvement of the approximation in finding the square root.

To break it down further using the substitution method:

1. Let's define `f` explicitly: `(define (f y) (/ x y))`.
2. Now, apply `average-damp` to `f`: `(define avg-damp-f (average-damp f))`.
3. The `average-damp` function then returns a new procedure that takes an argument `x` and computes `(average (f x) x)`.

So, when you call `(avg-damp-f x)`, it's equivalent to:

\[
\text{(lambda (x) (average ((lambda (y) (/ x y)) x) x))}
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
\text{(average (/ x x) x)}
\]

This expression ensures that the average dampening process is correctly applied, which is crucial for the convergence of the fixed-point iteration in finding the square root.",0.6258,[[0.52070502]],0.30972266984314045,0.38839455483899477,0.4986149584487534,0.15041782729805012,0.24376731301939059

",,"The provided code appears to be an attempt at implementing a stack using Common Lisp. However, there are some issues with it:

1. The `deftype` form is used incorrectly here. It should only define type metadata and cannot contain function definitions or other forms that return values.

2. The `stack-top` function and `stack-peek` function essentially do the same thing: they retrieve the top element of the stack. This can be simplified to use a single function, e.g., `stack-peek`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```lisp

I want a generic function that works with arbitrary type specifiers, including the list-based ones such as (and x y), (or x y), (satisfies p), etc. Now when I attempt to run the above code, I get an ""Invalid Specializer"" error. A little bit of research reveals that defgeneric is designed to work with CLOS, not with arbitrary type specifiers. Is there a defgeneric-like system in Common Lisp that would get me the behavior I want for arbitrary type specifiers, not just classes?
","Common Lisp defines two hierarchies which are related but not identical: the type hierarchy and the class hierarchy.  Every class is a type, but the converse is not true — there are types that are not classes.  For example, integer and string are classes, and therefore also types.  On the other hand, (integer 1 *) and (satisfies evenp) are types, but not classes.

Parameter specialisers — the things that you put after parameters in defmethod — can only be class names (or of the form (eql value)).  Since (integer 1 *) is not a class name, your code is not allowed by Common Lisp.  There is an excellent reason for that: the compiler is always able to determine the class hierarchy, while the type language is way too powerful for that:
(defun satisfies-the-collatz-conjecture (n)
  (cond
    ((<= n 1) t)
    ((evenp n) (satisfies-the-collatz-conjecture (/ n 2)))
    (t (satisfies-the-collatz-conjecture (+ 1 (* n 3))))))

(subtypep 'integer '(satisfies satisfies-the-collatz-conjecture))
NIL ;
NIL

If you really need your code to be modular, you will need to first classify your values into something that can be made into a specialiser, and then dispatch on that:
(defmethod fn-generic (x (sign (eql 'positive)))
  ""Positive integer"")

(defmethod fn-generic (x (sign (eql 'negative)))
  ""Negative integer"")

An idiomatic approach with S-expressions is to implement ad hoc validators and transformers, tailored for specific data formats.

"I've read that javascript was in part based on Scheme, a dialect of LISP. When I was reading about this and LISP, it struck me that the javascript function expression syntax seemed like a similar kind of structure.

If a javascript function treats the creation and reference of a function as just another variable (and arrays, strings, and numbers can all be assigned to variables too) does that mean that the javascript function expression is essentially a implementation of the s-expression idea?
","Sort of, they are first class functions which you can pass around as values.
This is very close to scheme's lexically scope lambda and lisp is the first language family to have this feature. but instead of the javascript function parameters having lexical they have ""function scope"".

"The cosine similarity of two lists can be calculated in linear time using a for-loop. I'm curious as to how one would achieve this using a Lisp-like language. Below is an example of my code in Python and Hy (Hylang).
Python:
def cos_sim(A,B):
    import math as _math
    n,da,db,d = 0,0,0,0

    for a,b in zip(A,B):
        n += a*b
        da += a*a
        db += b*b

    da = _math.sqrt(da)
    db = _math.sqrt(db)
    d = da*db

    return n / (d + 1e-32)

Hy (Lisp):
(import math)

(defn l2norm [a]
    (math.sqrt (reduce + (map (fn [s](* s s)) a))))

(defn dot [a b]
   (reduce + (map * a b)))

(defn cossim [a b]
   (/ (dot a b) (* (l2norm a) (l2norm b))))

","""I'm curious as to how one would achieve this using a Lisp-like language."" This really depends on which Lisp you are using. In Scheme you might do something similar to the posted Hy solution:
(define (cos-sim-1 u v)
  (/ (dot-prod u v)
     (* (norm u) (norm v))))

(define (dot-prod u v)
  (fold-left + 0 (map * u v)))

(define (norm u)
  (sqrt (fold-left (lambda (acc x) (+ acc (* x x)))
                   0
                   u)))

This is linear in time complexity, but it could be improved by a constant factor by passing over the input only once. Scheme provides a named let construct that can be used to bind a name to a procedure; this is convenient here as it provides a simple mechanism for building the dot product and norms:
(define (cos-sim-2 u v)
  (let iter ((u u)
             (v v)
             (dot-product 0)
             (U^2 0)
             (V^2 0))
    (if (null? u)
        (/ dot-product (sqrt (* U^2 V^2)))
        (let ((x (car u))
              (y (car v)))
          (iter (cdr u)
                (cdr v)
                (+ dot-product (* x y))
                (+ U^2 (* x x))
                (+ V^2 (* y y)))))))

Both of these procedures assume that the input lists have the same length; it might be useful to add some validation code that checks this. Note that fold-left is standard in R6RS Scheme, but other standards rely on SRFIs for this, and some implementations may use different names, but the fold-left functionality is commonly available (perhaps as foldl or reduce).
It is possible to solve the problem in Common Lisp using either of the basic methods shown above, though in Common Lisp you would use labels instead of named let. But it would be typical to see a Common Lisp solution using the loop macro. The Common Lisp standard does not guarantee tail call elimination (though some implementations do support that), so explicit loops are seen much more often than in Scheme. The loop macro is pretty powerful, and one way that you could solve this problem while passing over the input lists only once is this:
(defun cos-sim (u v)
  (loop :for x :in u
        :for y :in v
        :sum (* x y) :into dot-product
        :sum (* x x) :into u2
        :sum (* y y) :into y2
        :finally (return (/ dot-product (sqrt (* u2 y2))))))

Here are some sample interactions:
Scheme (Chez Scheme):

",,"In Lisp-like languages such as Hy, you can achieve cosine similarity using higher-order functions like `map`, `reduce`, and lambda expressions. The provided code already demonstrates a concise way to calculate the cosine similarity of two lists. However, let's break it down further for clarity:

```hy
(import math)

(defn l2norm [a]
    (math/sqrt (reduce + (map #(* % %) a))))

(defn dot [a b]
   (reduce + (map * a b)))

(defn cossim [a b]
   (/ (dot a b) (* (l2norm a) (l2norm b))))
```

Here's how the code works:
- `l2norm` computes the Euclidean norm of a list by summing the squares of its elements and then taking the square root.
- `dot` calculates the dot product of two lists by multiplying corresponding elements and then summing the results.
- `cossim` uses these functions to compute the cosine similarity. It divides the dot product of the two lists by the product of their norms.",0.5799,[[0.28228131]],0.012621161737290198,0.10889938216340703,0.20989505247376314,0.01804511278195489,0.0989505247376312

(interactive

    ""Append to buffer: ""
    (other-buffer (current-buffer) t))
    (region-beginning)
    (region-end)))

It's surprisingly hard to Google what ""list"" means in lisp, because every page is a hit. I'm guessing it just makes a list of its arguments, in which case, why is it better or clearer to use than just making a list ""manually"" with another set of parentheses?
","That's because you cannot just use ""another set of parentheses"" to make a list.
Here's an expression that creates a list containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.
(list 1 2 3 4)

However, you cannot use (1 2 3 4) or even ((1 2 3 4)) to express that.
",,"In Lisp, `list` is indeed used to create a list from its arguments. The use of `list` in this context serves several purposes that make it clearer and more convenient than manually constructing the list with parentheses. First, using `list` makes the code more readable by clearly indicating that you are creating a list without having to count or match parentheses. Second, `list` is a safe function; if any of its arguments are not provided, `nil` will be used in their place, which can prevent errors in your program. Finally, using `list` makes the code more robust and easier to maintain because it abstracts away the syntax details of list creation.",0.4978,[[0.35498215]],0.07429386976240224,0.2792256142963515,0.2331288343558282,0.037267080745341616,0.13496932515337423
"I think I understand why there is a danger in allowing closures in a language using dynamic scope.  That is, it seems you will be able to close the variable OK, but when trying to read it you will only get the value at the top of global stack.  This might be dangerous if other functions use same name in the interim.
Have I missed some other subtlety?
","Yes, that's the basic problem. The term ""closure"" is short for ""lexical closure"", though, which by definition captures its lexical scope. I'd call the things in a dynamically scoped language something else, like LAMBDA. Lambdas are perfectly safe in a dynamically scoped language as long as you don't try to return them.
(For an interesting thought experiment, compare the problem of returning a dynamically scoped lambda in Emacs Lisp to the problem of returning a reference to a stack-allocated variable in C, and how both are impossible in Scheme.)
A long time ago, back when languages with dynamic scope were much less rare than today, this was known as the funargs problem. The problem you mention is the upward funargs problem.
",,"Your understanding is correct and highlights a key issue with closures in languages that use dynamic scope. When a closure captures a variable in dynamically scoped languages, it indeed captures the variable at the time of creation of the closure, but when accessing this variable later through the closure, the language's dynamic scoping rules will resolve it based on the current call stack frame, not necessarily the one where the closure was created. This can lead to unexpected behavior if another function with the same name is bound in a different scope that the closure uses.

In addition to what you've mentioned, there are other subtleties:

1. **Temporal Coupling**: The value of the variable at the time of the closure's creation might not be what it will have when the closure is later used. This can lead to subtle bugs if the state of the environment changes between the creation and use of the closure.

2. **Debugging Complexity**: Debugging becomes more challenging because the value you expect in a closure may not match what you see at runtime due to dynamic scoping rules. The behavior can be inconsistent with expectations based on static analysis alone.

3. **Namespace Conflicts**: As you pointed out, if another function or variable shadows the name of a variable captured by a closure, this could lead to incorrect values being used when the closure is executed in different contexts.

These issues are why many modern programming languages use lexical scoping (where each scope has its own copy of variables) rather than dynamic scoping. Lexical scoping makes it clearer and safer to understand what a variable's value will be at any point during program execution.",0.5352,[[0.46662357]],0.10339352823932638,0.3399014778325123,0.3095823095823096,0.05432098765432098,0.13759213759213762
"I'd like to know if it's possible to and how to implement a module system.
Here's example of how it works: I have some folder (e.g. modules), this folder has a bunch of clojure files that export some variables (e.g. name and regex), All modules are loaded into one list so it's possible to iterate and modules can be removed from it.
","the simplest thing you could do, is to load all these files one by one with load-file. https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/load-file
otherwise you could precompile your plugins' namespaces and load them using some of the java's native techniques (which i don't know much about, but i guess there are some nice libs for that)
update:
for some directory named ""/my/path"" it could look like the following:
(run! #(load-file (.getAbsolutePath %))
      (rest (file-seq (java.io.File. ""/my/path""))))

notice, that the file seq traverses the directory recursively, and includes all the files (not only *.clj). Maybe you would have to filter them:
(run! #(load-file (.getAbsolutePath %))
      (filter
       #(clojure.string/ends-with? (.getName %) "".clj"")

A is the atom and (B C) is the list, but i don't really understand why....

why the first and the last parenthesis are not considered as being one list ?
why don't we count B and C as atoms here ?


Thanks in advance for any enlightenment on this weird thing :)
","I'd say the answer is wrong. For consistency with the previous answers, it should have been:

(A (B C)) : 2 lists, 3 atoms

Here's why: there are three atoms in total: A B C. There's a nested list: (B C) and an outer list: (A (B C)), totaling two lists.
It'd be correct to state that there's ""1 list, 1 atom"" if the question were ""count the top-level elements inside the list"" - but that's not consistent with the first two examples, which take into account all the atoms and lists shown, including the outer list.
",,"In Lisp, a list is a sequence of elements where each element can itself be another list. The structure you've provided, `(A (B C))`, is indeed composed of one list and one atom.

- `A` is an atom.
- `(B C)` is a nested list containing two atoms: `B` and `C`.

The reason the first and last parentheses are not considered as forming a single list in this context is because the structure explicitly defines two levels of nesting. The outermost level has one element, which is the list `(B C)`, plus another atom `A`. So, it's interpreted as having one top-level list containing one atom (`A`) and one nested list (`(B C)`).

If you were to consider only the first and last parentheses as defining a single list, then there would be no way to represent that the structure inside `(B C)` is itself a list. That’s why Lisp syntax requires each additional level of nesting to be properly enclosed.",0.6051,[[0.47267097]],0.17482783235932464,0.39945701990923277,0.4528301886792453,0.09885931558935362,0.23396226415094337

"I want to create a function that receives 2 arguments and returns a function that receives himself a board. That function needs to check user input and make changes in the board according to the input. I have no problems with the user input and the changes i have to do to the board. My problem is with the function that returns a function. To do that i'm using a lambda. This is the code i'm working on:
(defun faz-jogador-manual (n_aneis peca)

I don't know what i'm doing wrong, is it the call? is the function per se? I need help with this one.
","Common Lisp is a Lisp-2, which means that it has a separate namespace for functions and values; as a result, functions need to be treated slightly specially in this case.  (This is in contrast to most Lisps.)
When you return a function as a value, you can't just invoke it in the same way as if you had defined it with defun.  You need to use funcall or apply to do so.  You can do it like this:
;; insert an appropriate argument in place of tabuleiro for the inner function
(funcall (faz-jogador-manual 3 'X) tabuleiro)

If you want to understand this behavior in more detail, you can probably find lots of references online, like this one.
",,"The issue you are encountering stems from how you are using the `faz-jogador-manual` function. In Lisp, when a function that returns another function is called with arguments, those returned functions do not immediately execute unless explicitly invoked. Your current code does not invoke the lambda function that it creates.

To fix this, you need to call the lambda function after it has been created by invoking it as follows:

```lisp
(faz-jogador-manual 3 'X) ; This returns a lambda function but doesn't execute it.
((faz-jogador-manual 3 'X)) ; This calls the lambda function and executes it with the required argument.
```

By adding an additional set of parentheses around `(faz-jogador-manual 3 'X)`, you are invoking the returned lambda function, which then takes the `tabuleiro` as its argument.

Here's a revised version:

```lisp
(defun faz-jogador-manual (n_aneis peca)
  #'(lambda (tabuleiro)
      (setf jogada (le-posicao))
      (let ((num_anel (first jogada))

            (tab (copia-tabuleiro tabuleiro)))
        (tabuleiro-poe-peca tab peca num_anel posicao_anel))))

; Example usage:
(let ((player-func (faz-jogador-manual 3 'X)))
  (funcall player-func my-board)) ; Replace `my-board` with your actual board.

",,"In MIT-Scheme (and other Scheme implementations), you can use the debugger to inspect an anonymous compound-procedure. When you encounter an error like the one described, you can set a breakpoint using `trace` or `breakpoint`, and then run your program until it hits the point of interest.

Here's how you can do it:

1. **Set a Breakpoint**: Use `(breakpoint)` to stop execution at that point.
2. **Run Your Program**: Let the program run until it stops at the breakpoint.
3. **Inspect the Compound-Procedure**: Once stopped, you can inspect the structure of the procedure using tools like `disassemble` or by printing out the procedure itself.

For example:

```lisp
(define (foo x y)
  (lambda (z) (+ x y z)))

(set! bar (foo 2 3))
(breakpoint)

; Now run your program until it hits the breakpoint

(disassemble bar)
```

Using `disassemble` will give you a disassembled version of the procedure, which can help you understand what's happening. Alternatively, if you want to see the actual lambda expression:

```lisp
(write bar) ; or (display bar)
(newline)
```

This will output something like:

```
#[compound-procedure 65]
```

To get more details about the code inside `bar`, you can also use `(lambda-ast bar)` which provides a parsed representation of the lambda function, though this might not be available in all Scheme implementations.

Remember that the actual source line information is typically lost when procedures are compiled or when they are represented as closures.

"I am pretty new to using CLOS. Here, I wrote one possible way of defining a Queue using CLOS:
(defclass Queue ()
    ((queue-size
        :reader queue-size
        :initarg :queue-size
        :initform (error ""Provide a queue-size when initialising a Queue"")

    (elements
        :accessor elements
        :initform (make-array queue-size :initial-element nil))

        :accessor put-ptr
        :initform 0
        :type number)
    (get-ptr
        :accessor get-ptr
        :initform 0
        :type number)))

As you can see, I use the value of the slot queue-size to make the array in the slot elements. But, unfortunately, this gives me the following error:
*** - DEFAULT-ELEMENTS: variable QUEUE-SIZE has no value

As I said, I am pretty new to CLOS. Is there any way I can still do this? Is it possible to overwrite some kind of init method? If yes, how do I do this?
","In CLOS you can't directly refer to slots as variables. Also you can't refer to to other slots of the object in initforms.
The example, simplified:
CL-USER 27 > (defclass queue () (size elements))
#<STANDARD-CLASS QUEUE 4020001AB3>

CL-USER 28 > (describe (make-instance 'queue))

#<QUEUE 40200040CB> is a QUEUE
SIZE          #<unbound slot>
ELEMENTS      #<unbound slot>

We'll now set the elements slot:
CL-USER 36 > (defclass queue () ((size :initarg :size) elements))
#<STANDARD-CLASS QUEUE 42E0A2DBFB>

For that we write a initialize-instance :after method.
The usual initializing happens and after that our method runs. WITH-SLOTS allows us to use certain slots like variables in our code. Here we access the slots size and elements:
CL-USER 37 > (defmethod initialize-instance :after ((q queue) &rest initargs)
               (with-slots (size elements) q
                 (setf elements (make-array size :initial-element nil))))
#<STANDARD-METHOD INITIALIZE-INSTANCE (:AFTER) (QUEUE) 402000ADD3>

Without the macro WITH-SLOTS, using the function SLOT-VALUE, it looks like this:
CL-USER 38 > (defmethod initialize-instance :after ((q queue) &rest initargs)
               (setf (slot-value q 'elements)
                     (make-array (slot-value q 'size) :initial-element nil)))

",,"The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that `queue-size` hasn't been initialized when you try to use it to initialize `elements`.

This allows you to customize the initialization process, ensuring that `queue-size` and consequently `elements` are properly set up before any other operations are performed.",0.4765,[[0.34772914]],0.011032246594984339,0.11275720164609054,0.29333333333333333,0.040268456375838924,0.14

If I run:
(wait 5 (format t ""output""))

The result is that ""output"" will be sent to stdout before counting down. After outputting ""output"" the program still counts down as usual.
I get the expected results, in which ""output"" is sent to stdout AFTER the countdown is complete, with the following code:
(defun wait (seconds form)

Why would the call to EVAL in the DO loop be evaluating when the DO loop is declared, but directly inserting the form being evaluated causes it to wait until result time?
","First law of Lisp programming for beginners: no, you don't need eval.
Your function does not get a form (foo), but the result of evaluating (foo). All arguments to functions are evaluated BEFORE the function will be called. Lisp does not call a function with the forms of the arguments, but with the results of evaluating the arguments.
Your code
(wait                   ; function wait
  5                     ; argument expression 1
  (format t ""output""))  ; argument expression 2

What happens?

wait is a function, get it.
evaluate 5 -> 5
evaluate (format t ""output"") -> NIL + output as a side effect
call the function wait with the arguments 5 and NIL

Improvement: pass a function
If you don't want to run the argument in the call, create a function (lambda () (foo)), which will be evaluated to a function object, pass that to a variable delayed-function, and call it with (funcall delayed-function).
What happens here?
(wait
  5
  (lambda ()
    (format t ""output"")))


wait is a function, get it.
evaluate 5 -> 5
evaluate (lambda () (format t ""output"")) -> a function object
call the function wait with the arguments 5 and the function object

Now your function wait needs to do what it wants and call the passed function object at the right place - using FUNCALL.
",,"The difference in behavior arises due to how `eval` and `format t` are used within the `do` loop. In your original code, `(eval form)` is called immediately when the condition `((>= (get-universal-time) end))` is met, which means that `form` is evaluated right away, and its output is sent to stdout before the countdown completes. On the other hand, in the modified version where you directly use `(format t ",0.4903,[[0.31089483]],0.019192302395350053,0.12683198635579587,0.24548736462093862,0.02909090909090909,0.12996389891696752

It is working, except that all the princ invokations arrive at once, at the end. The idea here is that they are a progress indicator, printing a period to the screen every 1000 iterations.

In Lisp, you can achieve this by using the `force-output` function from the `sys:stdout` package or by calling `terpri` (which prints a newline) immediately after `princ`. Here's an example of how you might modify your loop:\n\n```lisp\n(loop for i below x\n      do (update-world)\n      if (zerop (mod i 1000))\n      do (progn (princ #\\.)

As I see it, using return statement in the middle of a function is not functional at all.

Unfortunately, we don't have it here. What should we do?

Simulate let with creating lots of nested functions and calling them in place?
Use something like Maybe monad or another complex stuff like that?
Don't waste our time and write it imperatively?
Something else?

","A return statement anywhere in a function is not functional.
In Python, you have no choice.
The Lisp code
(defun sgnum (x)
  (cond
    ((< x 0) -1)
    ((zerop x) 0)
   (t 1)))

turns into Python as
def sgnum(x):
  if x < 0:
    return -1
  elif x == 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return 1

In Lisp, we know we have deviated from functional coding when we use variable assignment, or the ""program feature"": an explicit progn construct, or an implicit equivalent, or any of is cousins like prog or prog1. A functional function in Lisp always has a body which is made up of a single expression (or possibly no expressions at all).
You can redefine what you mean by ""functional coding"" in Python. How about these
rules:

Every statement in a ""functional function"" must be a single statement; it cannot be followed by another statement. Thus, the whole body of a function is a single statement, and in it are embedded single statements.

No statement in the function may allow control to fall through it. Every statement must return. Thus return is not only considered ""functional"" but essential to achieving this goal.

A variable may be defined, but not redefined. Parallel, mutually exclusive control flows may assign the same variable different values, but no variable can be assigned more than once in the same control flow.


With these kinds of rules, you can get the program to have a control flow graph resembling that a program in the pure Lisp style: a control graph that is basically a tree of decisions with embedded calculations and variable binding, at the leaves of which are values to be returned.
Speaking of variable binding, we should probably have a fourth rule:

A statement may be preceded by a sequence of fresh variable assignments that contain no side effects. Such a sequence, together with the statement which follows it, counts as one statement.

Arguably also a fifth one:

No statement must be used which evaluates any contained expression or statement more than once.

Otherwise we permit loops, which are not functional. This is tricky because some looping constructs are relatively well behaved, like implicitly stepping a dummy variable over the elements of a list.  The only way you can tell it's not functional is that a lexical closure captured in the loop will easily reveal there is only one variable being mutated and not a fresh variable being bound for each iteration.
According to these rules, sgnum is ""functional"": it contains just one if/elif/else statement, which does not allow control to fall through it: every branch returns:
This version of sgnum is not ""functional"" any more:
def sgnum(x):
  if x < 0:
    return -1
  if x == 0:
    return 0
  return 1

It contains three statements in sequence. Whereas the following is ""functional"" even though it also consists of three statements:
def distance(x0, y0, x1, y1):
  xd = x1 - x0
  yd = y1 - y0
  return math.sqrt(xd * xd + yd * yd)

These meet the rules. The first two statements bind fresh variables, meeting rule 3, so are permitted by 4 to precede a statement. The return statement meets rules 1 and 2. This is very similar to:
(defun distance (x0 y0 x1 y1)
  (let ((xd (- x1 x0))
        (yd (- y1 y0)))
    (sqrt (+ (* xd xd) (* yd yd)))))

Lastly, note how our rules are at odds with the ancient programming advice of ""have only one exit point in a function"". That little tidbit you may find in some coding conventions is quite anti-functional. To achieve a single point of return in a nontrivial function requires imperative style control flows through multiple statements and/or variable assignments. From the functional point of view, it is a myopic, silly rule; but it makes sense in those contexts where it is recommended, because it can help improve very poorly structured imperative code.
",,"In Lisp, you can indeed simulate let with nested functions or use other control structures to handle such cases more idiomatically. Here are a few approaches you might consider:\n\n1. **Nested Functions:** You can create helper functions that encapsulate the computations and return values based on conditions.\n2. **Maybe Monad (or Optional Type):** If your Lisp dialect supports it, using an optional type or monadic pattern to handle potential failures gracefully is a clean approach.\n3. **Imperative Approach:** While not as idiomatic in functional programming languages, you can certainly write imperative code if that aligns better with your problem domain and team's preferences.\n\nGiven the functional nature of Lisp, I recommend exploring nested functions or using an optional type to maintain a more functional style while handling intermediate computations and failures.",0.5027,[[0.27843997]],0.0036033901915836076,0.07941073936786931,0.17010309278350516,0.020671834625323,0.08505154639175258
"I'm trying to understand the view that procedures and data are virtually the same in lisp. SICP says that:

the values of numerals are the numbers that they name, 
the values of built-in operators are the machine instruction sequences that carry out the corresponding operations, and 
the values of other names are the objects associated with those names in the environment. 

The second stipulation says that ""the values of built-in operators are the machine instruction sequences that carry out the corresponding operations."" if I wish to change the values thereby changing the machine instructions, like this:
  (define + 2)

  (* + 3) ;6

it works fine.
Now, the first case stipulates that ""the values of numerals are the numbers that they name"". If I type
  2

The value is the representation of 2 that gets outputted. Now, if I wish to change it, like this:
  (define 2 +) ;bad syntax

Why is that?
","In any definition of a language, you need a distinction between symbols (if you have symbols) or names, and literals (in languages which only have literals, some of which code for instructions, this is not necessary.)
In the lisp in your example, 2 and 3.1415 are literals - + may be a symbol. Thus, it makes sense that you can re-assign a symbol, or name, to point somewhere else. Literals, however, will always be data. They are distinct from names.
You could define a language where literals are, just like +, symbols mapped to a default value, able to be re-mapped if you wish. An example of such a language might be the C pre-processor.
EDIT: More generally, you comment was about how ""code is data"" in lisp. Your example is a bad example of this feature - it is a question which concerns the parser or grammar of the language and its tokens.
A better example would be the following:
(+ 2 3)

This expression is both an executable statement, and a data structure. Namely it can code for ""a function invocation which returns 5"" or, if prefixed by a ""do not evaluate me straight away '"" the pair structure
(+ . (2 . (3 . NIL)))

which is the standard linked list structure found in lisp implementations. You can pass this data structure around in code, execute it later with something like the EVAL function, or (most powerfully), edit it so that it does something else and then execute it.
This is possible because lisps are homoiconic - the source code works both as code and data.
",,"In Lisp, both procedures and data are represented as first-class objects. This means you can treat them similarly at runtime, which is what SICP aims to illustrate when it states that 'procedures and data are virtually the same.' However, there's a crucial difference between how numerals (like `2`) and built-in operators (like `+`) are treated in the language.

When you define `(define + 2)`, you're reassigning the symbol `+` to refer to the number `2`. This doesn't change the actual machine instructions for addition because they aren't directly modifiable through normal programming constructs. The symbol `+` is simply a name that gets bound to the value `2`. When you then call `(* + 3)`, it evaluates `+` to `2` and thus computes `(* 2 3)` which results in `6`.

On the other hand, when you try `(define 2 +)`, you're attempting to define a numeral (the number `2`) to be something else. In Lisp, numerals are literals; they don't have corresponding bindings or slots in the environment that can be directly assigned like symbols. Therefore, defining a literal such as `2` is not valid syntax and results in a 'bad syntax' error.

This distinction highlights the fundamental difference between numbers (data) and names (procedures or functions), even though both are first-class citizens in Lisp.",0.578,[[0.5388238]],0.16877662234349083,0.32415416413373854,0.4411764705882353,0.06751054852320676,0.1596638655462185

You need to quote the body of the macro, otherwise it will be evaluated and because its return value is nil, foo will simply return nil.

The macro expansion happens at compile-time, and you cannot pass arguments directly to a macro call in the same way you would with a function. However, when you invoke a macro from a function or another context, it behaves similarly to how a function might be used.

To diagnose your issue, let's correct and understand your code:

1. The `bar` macro is supposed to check if its argument is a symbol.
2. You need to use the backquote (``) and comma (`,) syntax for proper expansion within macros involving lists.

Here’s how you can define and use the macro correctly:

```lisp
(defmacro bar [arg]
  `(symbol? ,arg))

(defn foo [arg]
  (bar arg))

(foo 'baz)

In this corrected version, `bar` uses backquote syntax to expand its argument properly. When you call `(foo 'baz)`, it expands to `(symbol? baz)` and then evaluates that form.

This should work as expected:

(symbol? baz) ;; => true

"Basically, the title says it all: In Common Lisp, why is the null predicate called null. not nullp (to conform to other predicates such as evenp or oddp)? Is there a special reason for this?
","First of all, null is not the only one. See atom.
Second, I think these predicates are fundamental ones and thus, very old. I don't think the 'end with p' agreement was introduced from the very beginning of LISP.
Also interesting info on the topic:

By convention, the names of predicates usually end in the letter p (which stands for 'predicate'). Common Lisp uses a uniform convention in hyphenating names of predicates. If the name of the predicate is formed by adding a p to an existing name, such as the name of a data type, a hyphen is placed before the final p if and only if there is a hyphen in the existing name. For example, number begets numberp but standard-char begets standard-char-p. On the other hand, if the name of a predicate is formed by adding a prefixing qualifier to the front of an existing predicate name, the two names are joined with a hyphen and the presence or absence of a hyphen before the final p is not changed. For example, the predicate string-lessp has no hyphen before the p because it is the string version of lessp (a MacLisp function that has been renamed < in Common Lisp). The name string-less-p would incorrectly imply that it is a predicate that tests for a kind of object called a string-less, and the name stringlessp would connote a predicate that tests whether something has no strings (is ``stringless'')!

",,"In Common Lisp, the predicate `null` is named without 'p' (i.e., not `nullp`) due to its historical development and design philosophy. The `null` function checks if an object is nil or an empty collection (such as a list, vector, string, etc.). The naming convention for predicates in Common Lisp typically ends with 'p', but `null` predates this convention and was named based on the concept of 'nothingness' or 'emptiness.' This naming choice reflects the language's design to be simple and clear, especially when dealing with fundamental concepts like checking if something is non-existent or empty. Thus, `null` stands out as an exception to maintain consistency in its meaning across different contexts.",0.5572,[[0.40483439]],0.07218818323757396,0.19316909294512877,0.304,0.064343163538874,0.13866666666666666
"Most people agree that LISP helps to solve problems that are not well defined, or that are not fully understood at the beginning of the project.
""Not fully understood"""" might indicate that we don't know what problem we are trying to solve, so the developer refines the problem domain continuously. But isn't this process language independent?
All this refinement does not take away the need for, say, developing algorithms/solutions for the final problem that does need to be solved. And that is the actual work. 
So, I'm not sure what advantage LISP provides if the developer has no idea where he's going i.e. solving a problem that is not finalised yet.
","In AI (Artificial Intelligence) historically Lisp was seen as the AI assembly language. It was used to build higher-level languages which help to work with the problem domain in a more direct way. Many of these domains need a lot of 'knowledge' for finding usable answers.
A typical example is an expert system for, say, oil exploration. The expert system gets as inputs (geological) observations and gives information about the chances to find oil, what kind of oil, in what depths, etc. To do that it needs 'expert knowledge' how to interpret the data. When you start such a project to develop such an expert system it is typically not clear what kind of inferences are needed, what kind of 'knowledge' experts can provide and how this 'knowledge' can be written down for a computer.
In this case one typically develops new languages on top of Lisp and you are not working with a fixed predefined language.
As an example see this old paper about Dipmeter Advisor, a Lisp-based expert system developed by Schlumberger in the 1980s.
So, Lisp does not solve any problems. But it was originally used to solve problems that are complex to program, by providing new language layers which should make it easier to express the domain 'knowledge', rules, constraints, etc. to find solutions which are not straight forward to compute.
",,"Your observation is correct that problem refinement and algorithm development are crucial regardless of the programming language used. However, LISP does provide several advantages when dealing with problems that are not well-defined at the beginning of a project. These include its dynamic nature, macro system, and interactive environment. The dynamic typing and runtime evaluation capabilities allow developers to experiment more freely and quickly adapt their approach as they gain better understanding of the problem. Additionally, LISP's macros enable programmers to extend the language itself, which can be particularly useful in customizing development processes or creating domain-specific languages to model complex systems effectively. While the core work of solving a problem remains the same across any programming language, LISP offers powerful tools that can enhance productivity and flexibility during exploratory stages.",0.532,[[0.37822211]],0.09497231848185281,0.24405299357610083,0.34444444444444444,0.03910614525139665,0.13888888888888887
"I am trying to learn lisp, using emacs dialect and I have a question.
let us say list has some members, for which predicate evaluates to false.  how do I create a new list without those members?  something like { A in L: p(A) is true }. in python there is filter function, is there something equivalent in lisp?  if not, how do I do it?

","These functions are in the CL package, you will need to (require 'cl) to use them:
(remove-if-not #'evenp '(1 2 3 4 5))

This will return a new list with all even numbers from the argument.
Also look up delete-if-not, which does the same, but modifies its argument list.
",,"In Lisp, you can achieve this using the `remove-if-not` function or by using a combination of `remove-if` and negating your predicate. If Python's `filter` is what you're looking for, then `remove-if-not` is the closest equivalent in Lisp. Here’s how you can do it:

Using `remove-if-not`:
```lisp
(remove-if-not 'your-predicate-function your-list)
```

If you need to negate a predicate (for example, if you want elements where `p(A)` is false):
```lisp
(remove-if 'your-predicate-function your-list)
```

For instance, if you have a list of numbers and you want to remove all even numbers:
```lisp
(defun odd-p (n) (= (mod n 2) 1))
(remove-if-not #'odd-p '(1 2 3 4 5)) ; This will return (1 3 5)
```

This function `remove-if-not` returns a list of all the elements in your original list for which `(your-predicate-function element)` is true. If you want to remove elements where the predicate is false, just use `remove-if`.

((((5 .T ) .).).) 

","You need to return NIL in the (null list) case. When you don't have a return value in the matching COND clause, it returns the value of the condition, and (null list) returns T.
You also had some typos in the posted code: (cdr l) should have been (cdr list), and there was a missing ) at the end of that line.
(defun nopred (f list)

","I would propose to write a function which prints a file given a pathname and a stream.
You iterate with DO. That's okay, but I would use something like LOOP which allows slightly easier to read code.
Your DO is an endless loop. You might want to end the loop when the EOF is reached.
READ-LINE generates an error when it reads past the end of the file. Thus your code signals an error on the end of the first file. This error causes your code to only print the first file.
You need to call READ-LINE such a way that you test for EOF and end the iteration then. See the arguments to READ-LINE. Alternatively you can catch the EOF error, but the other solution is slightly easier.
",,"The issue with your code is that `read-line` reads a line from the file until it reaches EOF. After reading all lines from one file, there's an EOF condition on the stream, and `read-line` will not return any more lines when called again in the next iteration of the loop.

",,"In Common Lisp, variables do not hold references or pointers like they do in languages such as C or Python. When you set `b` to `(car (cdr a))`, `b` gets a copy of the value 2, and not a reference to it. Therefore, changing `b` does not affect the original list.

To achieve what you want—changing a part of a data structure—you can use proper lists or arrays with appropriate functions that allow modifying them in place. For example, you can modify the list by accessing and setting the correct position:

```lisp
(let ((a (list 1 2 3)))
  (setf (car (cdr a)) 4)

"So, I've been trying to wrap my head around the idea of clojure's code-as-data approach and it is definitely a bit confusing. It seems a lot like they are simply higher order functions of the sort. Is there a difference between these two concepts?
","Code-as-data is a big step further. HOF gives you code-as-data in the sense that you can pass executable blocks into other executable blocks, and compose them. But you can't manipulate the structure of the blocks themselves. It's kind of like working with objects that have only one method (call the function) but otherwise leak no data.
In full generality, code-as-data implies the code works like any other data structure in your environment, with contents you manipulate programatically. The homoiconicity @coredump mentioned greatly facilitates this because you can employ the exact same operations and transformations to a code block that you can apply to any other native data structure. But homoiconicity isn't strictly required. A lot of non-homoiconic languages provide metaprogramming features that let you achieve similar results, like Scala's macros and quasiquotes (for compile-time code manipulation) and toolboxes (for run-time complilation) or Python's ast.
",,"In Clojure (and Lisp more generally), the concept of code-as-data and higher-order functions are related but distinct. Code-as-data refers to the ability to treat code (expressions, functions, etc.) as data that can be manipulated, stored, and passed around like any other data type. This is achieved through macros and reader macros in Clojure.

Higher-order functions, on the other hand, are functions that take one or more functions as arguments or return a function as their result. This concept is central to functional programming and allows for powerful abstractions and flexibility in coding.

While there is an overlap because you can create higher-order functions from code-as-data (e.g., using `defn` to define a function dynamically), they are not the same thing. Code-as-data provides more flexibility by allowing dynamic construction and manipulation of expressions, while higher-order functions provide a way to pass behavior as arguments or return it from functions.",0.5664,[[0.40187173]],0.21986378429097753,0.36126600856543434,0.37735849056603776,0.0759493670886076,0.18238993710691823

","Simplest:
(define (display-all . vs)
  (for-each display vs))

Note the use of for-each instead of map - for-each is the same thing but assumes you're only calling the function for side-effects, so instead of returning a list of results (using map with display would return a list of voids) it just returns void.
This can get annoying if you want to display non-string things and have spacing between them, for instance if you want (display-all 12 ""bananas"") to display the string ""12 bananas"" you have to manually turn the number into a string and add the space yourself. It would be easier to just add spaces in-between elements of the list:
(define (insert-between v xs)
  (cond ((null? xs) xs)
        ((null? (cdr xs)) xs)
        (else (cons (car xs)
                    (cons v (insert-between v (cdr xs)))))))

(define (display-all . vs)
  (for-each display (insert-between "" "" vs)))

Now calling this:
(display-all ""blah"" 4 ""bloo"")

does what you'd expect. If you don't want the spaces inserted automatically, you can specify another argument as the separator object and use it however you need. Here's a version that accepts a separator object:
(define (display-all sep . vs)

",,"Your observation is correct. The function `assoc` can indeed be seen as a specialized version of `find`. Both functions are used to search for key-value pairs in an association list (alist), but they serve slightly different purposes and provide some extra functionality that the other does not.

- `assoc` is specifically designed to work with alists and will stop searching after finding the first matching pair, returning that pair. It returns `nil` if no match is found.
- `find`, on the other hand, is a more general function for searching sequences. By default, it continues checking all elements in the list until it finds one that satisfies the given test or reaches the end of the sequence.

In your examples:

1. `(assoc 'blue *mylist*)` returns `(BLUE . 5)` because `assoc` stops at the first occurrence.
2. `(find 'blue *mylist* :key #'car)` also returns `(BLUE . 5)` but might search the entire list if no match is found.

The extra functionality of `assoc` that you are not seeing in your example (but exists) includes:

- It can take a test function to determine equality, similar to `find`.
- It can return more specific information about the position and matching pair rather than just the first occurrence.

","Based on this question it would be:
(remove-if #'evenp '(0 1 2 3))

",,"The issue with your current implementation is that `mapcar` applies the lambda function to each pair of elements from the two lists (`h` and `x`). If the condition `(null a)` in the `cond` statement is satisfied, it returns `b`, otherwise, it returns the default value which is the second element of the list.

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```lisp\n(defun filter (f x)\n  (remove-if-not f x))\n```\n\nThis implementation uses the built-in `remove-if-not` function, which returns a list of all elements in `x` for which `f` returns true. If you specifically want to use the original logic with `mapcar`, you can modify your lambda function as follows:\n\n```lisp\n(defun filter (f x)\n  (let ((result '()))\n    (dolist (elem x result)\n      (when (funcall f elem) (push elem result)))))\n```\n\nIn this version, we use `dolist` to iterate over the list and a `when` statement to conditionally add elements that satisfy the predicate to the result list.

"So i started learning Lisp yesterday and started doing some problems.
Something I'm having a hard time doing is inserting/deleting atoms in a list while keeping the list the same ex: (delete 'b '(g a (b) l)) will give me (g a () l).  
Also something I'm having trouble with is this problem.
I'm suppose to check if anywhere in the list the atom exist.
I traced through it and it says it returns T at one point, but then gets overriden by a nil.
Can you guys help :)?
I'm using (appear-anywhere 'a '((b c) g ((a))))
at the 4th function call it returns T but then becomes nil.
(defun appear-anywhere (a l)
  (cond
   ((null l) nil)
   ((atom (car l))
    (cond
     ((equal (car l) a) T)
     (T (appear-anywhere a (cdr l)))))
   (T (appear-anywhere a (car l))(appear-anywhere a (cdr l)))))

","Let's look at one obvious problem:
(defun appear-anywhere (a l)
  (cond
   ((null l) nil)
   ((atom (car l))
    (cond
     ((equal (car l) a) T)
     (T (appear-anywhere a (cdr l)))))
   (T (appear-anywhere a (car l))(appear-anywhere a (cdr l)))))

Think about the last line of above.
Let's format it slightly differently.
(defun appear-anywhere (a l)
  (cond
   ((null l) nil)
   ((atom (car l))
    (cond
     ((equal (car l) a) T)
     (T (appear-anywhere a (cdr l)))))
   (T
    (appear-anywhere a (car l))
    (appear-anywhere a (cdr l)))))

The last three lines: So as a default (that's why the T is there) the last two forms will be computed. First the first one and then the second one. The value of the first form is never used or returned.
That's probably not what you want.
Currently your code just returns something when the value of a appears anywhere in the rest of the list. The first form is never really used.
Hint: What is the right logical connector?
",,"Sure, let's address your questions one by one. First, regarding inserting and deleting atoms in a list while keeping the list structure intact, you can use recursion along with helper functions to achieve this. Here is an example of how you might do it for deletion:\n\n```lisp\n(defun delete-atom (atom lst)\n  \",0.4953,[[0.16996634]],0.007412251368731957,0.088020985895942,0.16593886462882093,0.01762114537444934,0.08733624454148473
"In Common Lisp, I need to capture user input in the form of a list of reals. This list is terminated by two zeros in a row. For example, 5.0 0 6.0 3 2.0 5 1.0 7 13.0 8 0 0 should return the list (5.0 0 6.0 3 2.0 5 1.0 7 13.0 8). 
I've come across the function read-delimited-list, which takes a single character as an ending point. I can stop at a single zero, but I'm not sure how to expand this function, and I don't know of another function that takes a delimited string instead of a char. 
EDIT Thanks to the accepted answer, I've developed the following:
(butlast (loop for y = -1 then x for x = (read stream) until (and (= 0 x) (= 0 y))
    collect x)))

It seems a bit more readable to me (and at this point I'm openly admiting that my Lisp eyes are only 3 days old), and I'm not sure about performance implications (does collect append or reverse the list after the loop exits scope? is there an easier way to chop off the last element, or simply not append it?).
","For such simple case you can just use read in a loop, collect the results read so far and stop, when the last two are zeros.
(defun read-double-zero-terminated-list (stream)
  (do* ((prev -1 val)

read-delimited-list is intended for the cases of creating specialized syntax, so it's probably overkill here.
",,"Your approach using `butlast` and a loop with `read` is quite effective for capturing user input until two zeros are encountered. Here's an explanation of your code and some additional insights:\n\n1. The loop iterates by reading each number from the stream.\n2. It uses `(and (= 0 x) (= 0 y))` to check if both `x` and `y` are zero, which stops the loop.\n3. `butlast` is used to remove the last element of the list (which would be a zero in this case).\n\nRegarding performance:\n- In Common Lisp, `collect` collects elements into a list during the iteration, so it doesn't reverse the list after the loop exits scope; it builds the list in order.\n- To avoid appending an unwanted last element, you can use `butlast` as you have done. This is a clean and efficient way to handle this scenario.\n\nAlternative approaches could include reading all numbers into a list and then filtering out the final zeros, but your current method is quite idiomatic in Lisp.",0.5364,[[0.35305391]],0.08981565658315906,0.31924243026058924,0.2938775510204082,0.04938271604938271,0.13877551020408163

Thanks in advance!
Update:
Thanks for the answers, the settings are not overwritten.
It has to do with the ""default lisp indenting"".
In the :help lisp it says something about changing the p flag in
cpoptions. This is what it says in the help for the cpoptions flags:
p - Vi compatible Lisp indenting.  When not present, a slightly better algorithm is used.

Setting it does change the indent to one space instead of two spaces.
Still not sure how to change this to something else though.
","Looks like this is two-space indentation is a hard coded behavior of :set lisp mode which ignores shiftwidth.
We can trace this to the source code which contains a hard-coded amount += 2; increment statement.
It's that way for a good reason; it has come to be the predominant way of writing Lisp.
As I wrote this answer, I peeked at samples of source code the following projects (all Lisp or Lisp-like languages):

Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL);
Clozure Common Lisp (CCL);
GNU Emacs;
Clojure;
GNU Guile;
Racket;
and GNU CLISP.

I did not spot a single example of anything but two-space indentation! With two-space indentation, you are in good/large company. You might as well get used to that; even if you somehow get Vim to follow your way, if you upstream anything into anyone's Lisp project, you will likely have to reformat.
Now, I have seen Lisp code using four-space indentation, like in very old code bases and some books.
By the way, sometimes you see if indented like this:
(if (condition)
    (then)
    (else))

This may happen where indentation is four spaces, but I'm referring situations when this is alignment, and not four space indentation. This formatting is, of course, standard for function arguments, but controversial for operators such as if. Some people like it that way in their code bases. For instance, this institution's randomly found coding style guide recommends this way of writing if, while also recommending two-space indentation.
Vim will do the above if you remove if from lispwords.
The :set lispwords=... parameter contains a comma-separated list of identifiers which follow operator-like indentation, meaning two spaces rather than function-like alignment: second and third lines align with argument. By default, if is found in lispwords.
Lisp mode also applies two space indentation to a function (i.e. form not listed in lispwords, if there is no argument):
(gobbledygook 1 2 
              2 3)

(gobbledygook
  1)

That's also ""canonical"". Sometimes this comes in handy if you're trying to conform to some maximum line length; a function call running past the limit can sometimes be made to fit by moving all its arguments down, and just giving them two space indentation.
",,"The issue you are encountering is related to Vim's default behavior for Lisp indentation when the 'p' flag is set in the `cpoptions` setting. This flag enables Vi-compatible Lisp indentation, which uses two spaces instead of a single tab for indentation. To change this behavior and use tabs or a different number of spaces, you need to modify your `vimrc` file to change the value of `cpoptions`.

To disable the 'p' flag, add the following line to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
set cpoptions-=p
```

If you want to specify the number of spaces or tabs for indentation, you can use the existing settings like `tabstop`, `shiftwidth`, and `softtabstop`. However, since `p` flag is controlling the indentation style in this case, disabling it will allow Vim to use its default algorithm for indenting Lisp code.

If you prefer to use tabs instead of spaces, ensure that your `cpoptions` does not have the 'p' flag set, and set `expandtab` to false if necessary:

```vim
set noexpandtab
```

The problem is that I need initial-state to be the same every time it is passed to modify, but modify can be destructive.  I would simply make a copy, but I don't want to make any assumptions about what type of data initial-state is.
How can I make this happen?  Or is it even possible?
Thanks!
","If the function can be destructive and you cannot do anything about it then it's clear you need to make copies of initial-state.
One possibility to avoid preconfiguring what kind of data does initial-state contains is to leave providing a copy operation explicitly a problem for the caller or to make it a generic operation and relying on someone else to provide a method.
;; Version 1: the caller must provide a function that
;;            returns a new fresh initial state
(defun example (build-initial-state modify mod-list)
  (loop for modification in mod-list

(defun example (initial-state modify mod-list)
  (loop for modification in mod-list
        collecting (funcall modify (copy-state initial-state) modification)))

The first version is more general because it allows the state to be any object while in the second version the copy operation depends on state object type (and this means you cannot have two callers both using lists as state with a different copy semantic).
However copy-state is a general operation that can be probably used in other places and making the operation a generic increase usability (you don't need to pass around builder functions instead); it also allows the introduction of other generic operations like compare-state, write-state, read-state...
",,"In Common Lisp, you can use the `copy-sequence` function for sequences (like lists or vectors) and other type-specific copy functions if you know more about the data. However, since you want to avoid assumptions about the type of `initial-state`, a generic approach is needed. You can use the `cl-ppcre:regex-replace` function in combination with an empty string as the replacement to ensure immutability without making any type-specific copies.

Here's how you can modify your function:

```lisp
(defun example (initial-state modify mod-list)
  (loop for modification in mod-list

To handle different types of `initial-state` without assuming a specific type, you can wrap the state in a structure or use a higher-order function to ensure immutability. Here’s an example using a structure:

;; Example usage:
(let ((initial-state (make-state :value '(1 2 3))))

    (let* ((new-value (append state modification)))
      new-value))
  
  (example initial-state #'modify-example '((4)) '((5))))
```

In this example, `state` is a structure that holds the value. This way, you ensure that modifications to `initial-state` do not affect it directly.

Alternatively, if you are dealing with data types that can be copied using their specific functions (like arrays), you could use them:

```lisp
(defun copy-data (data)
  ;; Use appropriate copying function based on the type of data.
  (etypecase data
    (list (copy-list data))
    (vector (coerce data 'vector))))

(defun example (initial-state modify mod-list)
  (loop for modification in mod-list
        collecting (funcall modify (copy-data initial-state) modification)))
```

This ensures that `initial-state` is not modified by `modify`. If you can determine the type of `initial-state`, you can use specific functions like `copy-sequence` or `coerce`. However, if you cannot assume a type, wrapping it in a structure or using immutability techniques (like with strings or symbols) might be necessary.",0.6445,[[0.67660281]],0.2609397919796084,0.4130119278641695,0.49134948096885805,0.17361111111111113,0.2802768166089965
"This question arose when reading SICP. Why (list 'quote '(a b c)) evaluated by the interpreter (R5RS in Dr.Racket) as '(a b c). For me it should be (quote (a b c)). For instance (list 'quot '(a b c)) is evaluated as (quot (a b c)). What is so special in the 'quote?

",,"In Lisp, the form `(list 'quote '(a b c))` evaluates to `'(a b c)` because `'quote` is a special form that returns its argument unevaluated. When you write `'x`, it's equivalent to `(quote x)`.

This is why the result of `(list 'quote '(a b c))` is `'(a b c)`, which is a list containing the symbols `a`, `b`, and `c`.

On the other hand, if you were to write `(list 'quot '(a b c))`, Lisp interprets `'quot` as a symbol (since `quot` is not a special form in this context), and thus evaluates it, resulting in `(quot (a b c))`. This explains why your expectation of `(quote (a b c))` was not met.

The project you mentioned, cl-x86-asm, provides the first step by converting x86 assembly instructions into opcodes. To create a binary executable from these opcodes, you would need to combine the opcodes with any necessary headers (such as the PE header for Windows executables or ELF headers for Unix-like systems) and then write this data to a file. There are libraries available in Lisp that can help with this process, such as `binary-file` or `c-binary-stream`, which allow you to create binary files directly from your opcodes.

(loop for i upto 2 do (format nil ""~a"" ""Badger"")) ==>

","This depends on the first parameter of the format function, called destination (see the manual):

If destination is a string, a stream, or t, then the result is nil. Otherwise, the result is a string containing the ‘output’

In the first case, format writes to the standard output (you see the three ""Budger"") and returns NIL. But you do not see that value, but the value returned by loop, which is NIL. In fact, no clause in LOOP is present  (like RETURN) to return something different from NIL.
In the second case, format returns the string, but the value of the loop is again NIL, which is result of the whole form.
If you want to return the result of the format, you could, for instance, write:
(with-output-to-string (s)
   (loop for i upto 2 do (format s ""~a"" ""Badger"")))

"I'm trying to understand the scheme code of make-counter procedure. It's a higher order procedure (a procedure outputs another procedure) and I'm stuck with it.
(define make-counter
  (lambda (n)
    (lambda () 
      (set! n (+ n 1))
      n)))

(define ca (make-counter 0))
(ca)
(ca)

This outputs 1 and 2 respectively as expected. Why do we need 2 nested procedures here? What are their functions individually?
I'd be appreciated if someone explains in details. Thanks from now on.
","Indented properly, this is:
(define make-counter
  (lambda (n)
    (lambda ()
      (set! n (+ n 1))
      n)))

By the way, you can use a different syntax:
(define (make-counter n)
  (lambda ()
    (set! n (+ n 1))
    n))

make-counter is a function that accepts a number n and returns an object called closure, which acts like a function but contains a state. Different invocations of  make-counter will produce different closures, even when given the same n in argument. A closure can be called using the function-call syntax, as you experimented.
When you call the closure, the code that is contained within is executed. In your example, the closure accepts zero arguments, and mutates the variable named n. Again, the binding from n to a value is local to the closure and different for all instances of counters. But inside a particular counter, n always refer to the same memory location.
A call to the set! function changes what n evaluates to, and replaces the previous value with (+ n 1), incrementing the local counter variable.
",,"The `make-counter` procedure is a higher-order function that returns another procedure. Let's break down why it uses two nested procedures and what each does individually:

1. **Outer Lambda (make-counter):**
   ```lisp
   (define make-counter
     (lambda (n)
       ...))
   ```
   - This lambda takes one argument `n`, which is the initial value of the counter.
   - The purpose of this outer lambda is to create and return an inner procedure. It's a factory function that generates new procedures with their own state.

2. **Inner Lambda:**
   ```lisp
   (lambda ()
     (set! n (+ n 1))
     n)
   ```
   - This inner lambda has no arguments.
   - When called, it increments the counter `n` by 1 using `(set! n (+ n 1))`.
   - It then returns the current value of `n`.

### Why Two Nested Procedures?

- **Encapsulation and State Management:**
  - The outer lambda encapsulates the state (`n`) within its environment. This means that each call to `make-counter` creates a new context with its own copy of `n`.
  - When you create multiple counters using `make-counter`, they operate independently because each one has its own `n`.

- **Closure:**
  - The inner lambda is a closure, meaning it captures the value of `n` from its parent environment (the scope created by the outer lambda).
  - This allows the counter to maintain its state between calls.

### Example Usage:

```lisp
(define ca (make-counter 0))
(ca) ; Output: 1
(ca) ; Output: 2

(define cb (make-counter 5))
(cb) ; Output: 6
(cb) ; Output: 7

(ca) ; Output: 3
```

- `ca` and `cb` are two separate counters with their own state.
- Incrementing one does not affect the other.

In summary, using nested procedures in this way allows you to create multiple independent counters each with its own initial value and state.",0.6362,[[0.52321812]],0.21881095265989972,0.40125702391855833,0.44097995545657015,0.12080536912751677,0.19599109131403114
"I want to create the equivalent of a ""nested LET"" as in Haskell, where I can refer to some values bound in the outer LET. The caveat is that the function defined in the inner scope needs to dispatch on the type of its argument, so defgeneric came to mind.
Now this is my confusion: I have only ever defined this at ""top level"" (at package scope); is it possible to define it within an arbitrary lexical context ?
If not, is there a recommended alternative ? One hacky solution would be to pass the ""context"" as a defstruct argument to the function, I'm hoping there's something better ?
(I hope my intent is not lost in translation!)
Edit: This was a stupid question, I should have just tried it. In case someone looks for the answer to this, it is YES, and also ""of course"", (duh)
As a simple example,
(let ((x 4))  
      (defgeneric bar (y))  
      (defmethod bar ((y integer)) (1+ y))  
      (bar x))

evaluates to
5

","You can do that. It has a few downsides.

DEFMETHOD and DEFGENERIC are top-level forms. This means that the file compiler recognizes them and then knows about them. Inside a LET, these forms are no longer top-level forms and the compiler does not recognize them.
It makes debugging harder. Suddenly there is a context for methods.
It makes updating methods harder. I can't not just evaluate a DEFMETHOD form to update the method, I would also need to evaluate the context.

There are two typical ways to use a context at runtime:

Use a dynamic binding at runtime
Use a parameter at runtime

Example for 1:
(let ((*user* (find-current-user)))
  (declare (special *user*))
  (serve-page ...))

Alternatively the special variable could be declared global.
Example for 2:
(serve-page ... :user (find-current-user))

Even a plain package local variable can be good enough...
",,"Yes, it is possible to define generic functions within an arbitrary lexical context in Lisp. The `defgeneric` and `defmethod` forms can indeed be used within a `let` or any other scope where variables are bound. Your example demonstrates this perfectly: the `defgeneric` and `defmethod` forms are defined within the lexical scope of `(let ((x 4)) ...)` and successfully reference the value of `x`.

In cl-mongo, you translate ""object""s to kv forms, and ""array""s to lists.  Many mongo operators have shorthands defined, but I think $or is not one of them, so you'd need to either define that or do it explicitly:
(kv ""$or""
    (list ($> i 3)

A convenience macro for $or might look like this:

"Right to the point, in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4696618/is-haskell-a-lisp?answertab=votes#tab-top, there is a comment by Kevin Cantu saying:

Yeah, moving beyond the syntax alone, JavaScript is probably more of
  a Lisp than Haskell. (Originally conceived as a Scheme
  implementation...)

It's immediately quite clear that JS and Lisp have strong ties at the
  semantics level [...]

I am familiar with Lisp and functional programming, but not with JavaScript. So these propositions made wonder how powerful is JavaScript. What I've read so far is that it provides lambda expressions and closures. What more functional programming concepts and Lisp-like features does it provide? Does it provide, for instance, tail call recursion, or macros, or ability to manipulate code as data (like Lisp)?
","Some things that JavaScript provides that can be considered ""Lisp-like"":

First class functions (inc. lambdas and closures)
Dynamic typing 
Dynamic object model that has some similarities with CLOS
A readable data format that matches the source code format (JSON)
Run time evaluation with an ""eval"" function (that can be used in an interactive REPL)

Some things that Javascript doesn't have that are pretty common or central to other Lisps:

A homoiconic representation for both code and data (S-expressions)
Built in literals for linked lists / sequences
Support for immutable data structures in general (especially true for Clojure, where every data structure is persistent and immutable)
An extensive macro system for meta-programming
Optional static typing for performance optimisation (e.g. type hints in Common Lisp or Clojure)
Concurrency support
Tail call optimisation 

",,"JavaScript is a powerful and flexible language that indeed shares some similarities with Lisp. Here are some key features that make JavaScript resemble functional programming and Lisp-like paradigms:

1. **Lambda Expressions**: JavaScript supports anonymous functions, which can be used as lambda expressions.
2. **Closures**: JavaScript provides closures, allowing inner functions to access variables from the outer function.
3. **Higher-Order Functions**: JavaScript has built-in higher-order functions such as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
4. **Prototype-Based Inheritance**: Although not directly functional programming, prototype-based inheritance can be used in a more dynamic way similar to Lisp's object system.

However, there are several features that differentiate Lisp from JavaScript:

1. **Tail Call Recursion**: JavaScript does support tail call optimization (TCO) in some environments and browsers, but it is not a built-in language feature like in Scheme or other functional languages.
2. **Macros**: JavaScript does not have native macro capabilities like Lisp. While there are libraries that can simulate macros, they do not provide the same level of power as Lisp macros.

JavaScript's ability to manipulate code as data (code as first-class citizens) is somewhat limited compared to Lisp. In Lisp, you can operate on code as if it were any other data type, which allows for powerful metaprogramming. JavaScript has some capabilities in this area through template literals and dynamic evaluation of strings that contain code, but these are not as seamless or comprehensive.

In summary, while JavaScript has several features that make it resemble functional programming and Lisp-like languages, it lacks certain advanced features such as native tail call recursion, macros, and full metaprogramming capabilities.

Here’s an example:\n\n```lisp\n(defun update-slot (slot-name current-instance previous-instance)\n  (let ((current-value (slot-value current-instance slot-name))\n        (previous-value (slot-value previous-instance slot-name)))\n    (when (eq current-value previous-value)\n      (setf (slot-value current-instance slot-name) \n            (random-not-item current-value *exp*)))))\n\n;; Example usage:\n(let ((current-trial (make-instance 'class-name))\n      (previous (make-instance 'class-name)))\n  (mapc #'(lambda (slot-name) (update-slot slot-name current-trial previous)) '(letter number font color height)))\n```\n\nIn this formulation, you define a function `update-slot` that takes the slot name and both instances as arguments. This function then uses `slot-value` to get the current value of the slot from both instances and compares them. If they are equal, it sets the new value using `setf`. The `mapc` function is used to iterate over a list of slot names, applying the `update-slot` function for each one.

"I want to implement my particle filtering algorithm in parallel in Common Lisp. Particle Filtering and sampling can be parallelized and I want to do this for my 4-core machine. My question is whether programming in parallel is feasible in CL or not and if it is feasible are there any good readings, tutorials about getting started to parallel computing in CL. 
","Definitely feasible!
The Bordeaux Threads project provides thread primitives for a number of implementations; I would suggest using it instead of SBCL's implementation-specific primitives (especially if you aren't on SBCL!).
The thread primitives are provided by bt are, however, quite primitive.  I've used and enjoyed Eager Future2 which builds on bt to provide concurrency features using futures.  You can create futures that are computed lazily, eagerly (immediately), or speculatively.  The speculative futures are computed by a thread pool whose size can be customized.
I started a little project to provide parallel versions of CL functions using EF2, but it's only about three functions so far, so it won't be of much use to anyone.  I do of course welcome other coders to hack on it and submit pull requests, and I hope to do more work on it in the future.
There are many other libraries listed on Cliki that I haven't tried myself.
As far as tutorials, I don't know of any, but the concurrency features provided are found in other languages as well and good algorithms and practices are not generally language-specific.
If you're interested in reading a book, I recommend The Concurrent C Programming Language.  The authors describe a new programming language, based on C, with concurrency as a language feature. Of course, due to the nature of CL, it would likely be possible to implement these features without resorting to creating a new compiler. In my opinion the book presents excellent concurrency concepts, and addresses many of the problems you may encounter or fail to consider in writing concurrent programs.

"Is there a way to compare two functions for equality? For example, (λx.2*x) == (λx.x+x) should return true, because those are obviously equivalent. 
","It's pretty well-known that general function equality is undecidable in general, so you'll have to pick a subset of the problem that you're interested in. You might consider some of these partial solutions:

Presburger arithmetic is a decidable fragment of first-order logic + arithmetic.
The universe package offers function equality tests for total functions with finite domain.
You can check that your functions are equal on a whole bunch of inputs and treat that as evidence for equality on the untested inputs; check out QuickCheck.
SMT solvers make a best effort, sometimes responding ""don't know"" instead of ""equal"" or ""not equal"". There are several bindings to SMT solvers on Hackage; I don't have enough experience to suggest a best one, but Thomas M. DuBuisson suggests sbv.
There's a fun line of research on deciding function equality and other things on compact functions; the basics of this research is described in the blog post Seemingly impossible functional programs. (Note that compactness is a very strong and very subtle condition! It's not one that most Haskell functions satisfy.)
If you know your functions are linear, you can find a basis for the source space; then every function has a unique matrix representation.
You could attempt to define your own expression language, prove that equivalence is decidable for this language, and then embed that language in Haskell. This is the most flexible but also the most difficult way to make progress.

",,"In Lisp, comparing two functions for equality based on their behavior is not straightforward because functions are often closures that capture their environment, making them unique objects even if they behave identically. However, you can compare the source code or the lambda expressions of the functions to check for equivalence. For example, in Common Lisp, you could use a function like the following to achieve this:\n\n```lisp\n(defun func-equal-p (fn1 fn2)\n  \",0.533,[[0.40244569]],0.02928755683937224,0.12195121951219512,0.22910216718266255,0.037383177570093455,0.12383900928792568

","The REPL prints the value of each expression it executes
If you use the READ EVAL PRINT LOOP, the REPL will print the result. That's why it is called Read Eval Print Loop.
But output functions themselves will not print their result.

hello      ; <- printed by FORMAT
NIL        ; <- printed by the REPL

CL-USER 2 > (format t ""world"")
world      ; <- printed by FORMAT
NIL        ; <- printed by the REPL

You can execute Lisp code without a REPL
If you use Lisp without a REPL, no values are printed anyway:
$ sbcl --noinform --eval '(format t ""hello world~%"")' --eval '(quit)'
hello world

Alternatively you can have Lisp execute a Lisp file:

Does anyone have ideas about the difference between & and * in function/macro signature? Is there any documentation to explain this syntax?
","In clojure binding forms (let, fn, loop, and their progeny), you can bind the rest of a binding vector to a sequence with a trailing &. For instance,

Uses of * and other uses of & are conventions for documenting the structure of argument lists. 
",,"In Clojure, both `&` and `*` are used to denote variadic arguments (functions that can take a varying number of arguments), but they serve slightly different purposes.

- `*`: This symbol is used in function definitions to indicate that the last argument is a collection of values. When such a function is called with more than one value for this argument, all these values are collected into a single list or vector (depending on the context) and passed as the final argument. For example, in `(doseq seq-exprs & body)`, `seq-exprs` will be a collection of sequences.

- `&`: This symbol is used to denote that a function can accept an arbitrary number of positional arguments beyond the named parameters it defines. When called, all remaining unnamed arguments are collected into a list and passed as the argument associated with `&`. For example, in `(thread & body)`, `body` will be treated as a single list containing all the forms (expressions) that follow.

"I learn emacs lisp now and I wonder why it maybe useful to treat code as data. What a benefits of this approach. I saw one explanation as this is alternative to traditional Von Neumann architecture where exists clear separattion between data and code. 
I'd like to understand a meaning for this decision, get the idea. 
Thanks in advance, Nick.  
","You can write code that will write code for you. This can be done in two ways:

First, your program can create new code as a list and pass it to the eval function, which will evaluate the new code at runtime (however, eval is something you should not abuse -- actually, it should be used seldomly, when you really need it). You could theoretically do this in languages that do not have the homoiconicity property, but it would be a lot harder. 
For example, in Scheme you may do this

(define form '(x 10))
(set! form (append 'define form)
(eval form (interaction-environment)

and the value of x will be 10 after that. This could be used, for example, in Genetic Programming

You may also define macros. A macro is a little function that reads something that looks like a function call, but is translated (expanded) into something else before the program starts evaluating forms (that is, before it is run). For example, in many Lisps or is a macro. This code,

(or a b c)

is translated into
(let ((tmp1 a))
  (if tmp1
      tmp1
      (let ((tmp2 b))
        (if tmp2
            tmp2
            (let ((tmp3 c))
              (if tmp3
                  tmp3
                  #f))))))

You could implement or as a function, but then the function would have to evaluate all its arguments before returning. Since or is a macro, it will not necessarily evaluate all arguments. 
You can read more about macros in Wikipedia and in this cool book [ beside several other places on the net, like here, 
here and here for example ]. And you can read about eval in Wikipedia and in this great book.
You can also read Paul Graham's On Lisp (the book is completely free), which teaches basic Common Lisp in a somewhat fast pace and then gets into all kinds of programming techniques with macros, and later you can try Let Over Lambda (only some chapters are free).
About eval it may be interestig to read this question and its answers.
",,"Treating code as data is a powerful paradigm that allows Emacs Lisp (and many other Lisps) to provide flexible and dynamic behavior. This approach has several benefits:

1. **Flexibility and Extensibility**: Code can be manipulated, evaluated, and transformed just like any other data. This means you can write programs that generate or modify their own code at runtime, enabling highly customizable and extendable systems.

2. **Metaprogramming**: By treating code as data, you can write programs that can read, analyze, transform, and even automatically generate new code. Metaprogramming in Emacs Lisp allows for powerful automation of repetitive tasks and dynamic configuration of the editor environment.

3. **Dynamic Behavior**: Unlike traditional Von Neumann architectures where code is separate from data, in Lisps like Emacs Lisp, you have the ability to dynamically change how your program behaves at runtime. This can be particularly useful in environments that require flexibility or adaptability to changing conditions.

4. **Consistency and Uniformity**: In a Lisp, everything (including functions) is represented as data. This uniform representation simplifies many aspects of programming, making it easier to write and reason about programs. It also means you don't need to worry about different types of values; they are all treated uniformly under the hood.

5. **Macro Expansion**: One of the most powerful features in Emacs Lisp (and other Lisps) is macro expansion. Macros allow you to define new syntax, which can make your code more expressive and easier to write. This is a direct result of treating code as data, allowing macros to generate or transform code at compile time.

6. **Interactive Development**: The ability to treat code as data facilitates an interactive development environment where you can experiment with changes without restarting the program. Emacs Lisp's REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) allows you to interactively test and refine your code in real-time, which is a significant advantage for rapid prototyping and debugging.

Understanding these concepts provides insight into why treating code as data is such an important aspect of Lisps like Emacs Lisp. It enables the kind of dynamic and flexible programming that makes Emacs so powerful.",0.5233,[[0.48206416]],0.1795261992417631,0.3201473976754842,0.3700440528634361,0.058910162002945514,0.1527165932452276
"I am reading SICP's first chapter 
1.1.3  Evaluating Combinations
It states that 
To evaluate a combination, do the following: 

1.  Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.

2.  Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression (the operator) to the arguments that are the values of the other subexpressions (the operands). 

Suppose an combination (+ 1 2)
According to the above algorithms,
The first is to evaluate (retrieve) + 1 and 2)
The second is to apply + to 1 (store the intermediate state)
The third is to evaluate(retrieve)  the intermediate state and 2 again.
The forth is to apply the intermediate state to 2.
Is it right?
What' the intermediate state of +1?
","The expression (+ 1 2) is a combination composed by the primitive expressions: +, 1, and 2.
The first step says to evaluate all the subexpressions. In this case they are, respectively, the operator which performs the sum of numbers, and the numbers corresponding to the numerals 1 and 2, respectively.
So you have an operator, and two numeric values. The second step says that you must apply the operator (leftmost value) to the two numbers: in other words you must apply the sum operator to 1 and 2, so to obtain the number 3. And the process terminate.
Note that there are no intermediate states in this computation.
",,"Your understanding of evaluating a combination (+ 1 2) is almost correct but needs some clarification. According to SICP and Lisp evaluation rules:

1. Evaluate the subexpressions: +, 1, and 2.
   - The result of this step would be the value of + (which is the addition procedure), 1, and 2.

2. Apply the operator (the leftmost subexpression) to its operands:
   - Here, you correctly identify that we apply the value of + to the values of 1 and 2.
   
The intermediate state in this context refers to the value obtained after evaluating the first step (subexpressions). Specifically:

- The intermediate state would be the procedure object representing the addition function (+), with 1 and 2 as arguments.

Then, the evaluation proceeds by applying this procedure to its arguments. So, you don't need to evaluate/retrieve the intermediate state again; it's already in a form that can be applied to the remaining operand (2).

To clarify:
- The first step yields: (+, 1, 2)
- The second step applies (+) to (1, 2), resulting in the value 3.

The concept of an 'intermediate state' here is more about understanding the current form of the expression before it's fully evaluated.",0.6414,[[0.70273105]],0.2199811551873291,0.3948594394255372,0.4444444444444444,0.1830508474576271,0.2558922558922559
"Several weeks ago, SBCL updated 2.0.2 and brought the Block compilation feature. I have read this article to understand what it is. 
I have a question, what's the difference between (declaim (inline 'some-function)) and Block compilation? Block compilation is automatic by the compiler? 
Thanks.
","Inline compilation is a specific optimization technique. A function being called is directly integrated into the calling function - usually using its source code - and then compiled.
This means that the inlined function might not be inlined only in one function, but in multiple functions.
Advantage: the overhead of calling a function disappears.
Disadvantage: the code size increases and the calling function(s) needs to be recompiled, when the inlined function changed and we want this change to become visible. Macros have the same problem.
Block compilation means that a bunch of code gets compiled together with different semantic constraints and that this enables the compiler to do a bunch of new optimizations.
Common Lisp has in the standard support for block compilation of single files. It allows the file compiler to assume that a file is such a block of code.
Example from the Common Lisp standard:
3.2.2.3 Semantic Constraints

A call within a file to a named function that is defined in the same file refers to that function, unless that function has been declared notinline. The consequences are unspecified if functions are redefined individually at run time or multiply defined in the same file.

This allows the code to call a global function and not use the symbol's function cell for the call. Thus this disables late binding for global function calls - in this file and for functions in this file.
It's not said how this can be achieved, but the compiler might just allocate the code somewhere and the calls just jump there.
So this part of block compilation is defined in the standard and some compilers are doing that.
Block compilation for multiple files
If the file compiler can use block compilation for one file, then what about multiple files? A few compilers can also tell the file compiler that several files make a block for compilation. CMUCL does that. SBCL was derived and simplified from CMUCL and lacks it until now. I think Lucid Common Lisp (which is no longer actively sold) did support something like that, too.
Might be useful to add this to SBCL, too.
",,"The `declaim (inline 'some-function)` directive in Lisp instructs the compiler to try and inline a specific function call. Inlining means replacing a function call with its body at compile time, which can sometimes result in more efficient code by reducing the overhead of a function call.

On the other hand, Block compilation is a feature that allows the compiler to optimize entire blocks of code together, potentially leading to better optimization opportunities across the block as a whole. It does not automatically inline functions within the block; it focuses on optimizing the entire block of code as one unit.

Block compilation is controlled by specific compilation hints and is an automatic process managed by the SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) compiler based on certain conditions and heuristics, rather than being explicitly requested with a directive like `declaim`. You can use the `optimize` directive to influence block compilation behavior, but it's not as direct as using `inline` declarations.",0.5731,[[0.53476298]],0.10732177878110861,0.1982489174342859,0.3720930232558139,0.10116731517509728,0.1937984496124031

","Syntax errors
Your code contains several syntax errors that are flagged as compiler warnings:
CL-USER> (defun TREE-CONTAINS (N TREE)
           (cond (( = (car TREE) nil) nil)
                 (( = (car TREE) N) t)
                 (t TREE-CONTAINS (N (cdr TREE)))
            )
          )
;Compiler warnings :
;   In TREE-CONTAINS: Undeclared free variable TREE-CONTAINS
;   In TREE-CONTAINS: Undefined function N
TREE-CONTAINS

The reason is that parentheses in Common Lisp have a meaning different from that of other programming languages: they are not used to specify the order of application of the operators (like in 3 * (2 + 4) which is different from 3 * 2 + 4), but are integral part of the syntax to specify the different parts of a “statement”, like in cond or in function application (like (function-name arg1 arg2 ... argn)). So the syntax error in this case is in the last line, in which you should call the function TREE-CONTAINS with arguments N and (cdr TREE) as:
CL-USER> (defun TREE-CONTAINS (N TREE)
           (cond (( = (car TREE) nil) nil)
                 (( = (car TREE) N) t)
                 (t (TREE-CONTAINS N (cdr TREE)))
            )
          )
TREE-CONTAINS

Semantic errors
If you try this function, however, you will find an error:
 CL-USER> (TREE-CONTAINS 2 '(1 2 3))

 The value NIL is not of the expected type NUMBER.

The reason is that you have used = to compare a number ((car TREE)) with the value nil, while = can be used only to compare numbers. Use eq or eql instead for the general case:
CL-USER> (defun TREE-CONTAINS (N TREE)
           (cond (( eql (car TREE) nil) nil)
                 (( = (car TREE) N) t)
                 (t (TREE-CONTAINS N (cdr TREE)))
            )
          )
TREE-CONTAINS

CL-USER> (TREE-CONTAINS 2 '(1 2 3))
T

There is also another problem: you should check if the list is empty, not if the first element is nil. In other words, the first condition should be:
(cond ((eq TREE nil) nil)

or better:
(cond ((null TREE) nil)

Stylistic notes

A list is a particular case of tree: if you use the term tree the program should be more complex, taking into account cases in which the elements can be sublists.
Use lowercase identifier, since everything is translated to upper-case
Put the close parentheses at the end of the expression, not on a new line.

So your function could be something like:
(defun list-contains (n list)
  (cond ((null list) nil)
        ((= (car list) n) t)
        (t (list-contains n (cdr list)))))

Check membership for a tree and not a list
If, on the other hand, you want to check for a generic tree, i.e. a list which can contain sublists, like in (tree-contains 3 '((1 2 3) 7 8)), in your recursion you should consider tha case in which an element of the list is itself a list, and then perform a double recursion. Here is a possible solution:
CL-USER> (list-contains 2 '(1 (2 3) 4))

The value (2 3) is not of the expected type NUMBER.

"I am attempting to understand the lambda notion found within Emacs Lisp. 
In ielm, executing:
((lambda (x) (* x x)) 5)

*** Eval error ***  Symbol's function definition is void: f

Don't know why, I am sure the syntax is right and f is defined in the let?
Using cl-flet to define let-ed function
We can actually do this without using funcall.  The cl module includes standard functions from Common Lisp.  We first import it:
(require 'cl)

Thereafter we can use cl-flet to define our function:
(cl-flet ((f (x) (* x x)))
  (f 7))

","I'd be surprised if this isn't a duplicate, but I can't find it readily here on Stack Overflow. In ""Lisp-2"" languages (e.g., Emacs Lisp and Common Lisp), there are separate namespaces for functions and variables.  A function call looks like:
((lambda ...) ...) ; call the lambda function

or 
(f ...) ; call the function binding of f

If you want to call the function that is the value of a variable, then you need to use funcall or apply:
(apply f ...)

(funcall f ...)

The difference between apply and funcall is well documented in other places, but the quick difference is that apply expects an argument list (in some Lisps, a ""spreadable argument list""), whereas funcall takes the arguments directly.  E.g., 
(let ((f (lambda (a b) (+ a b))))
  (funcall f 1 2)      ; arguments directly
  (apply f '(1 2)))    ; arguments in a list

In a ""Lisp-1"", (like Scheme), you don't need funcall, since there's only one space for bindings.  In Scheme you can do:
(let ((f (lambda (a b) (+ a b))))
  (f 1 2))

The difference between Lisp-1 and Lisp-2 languages is described more in What is the difference between Lisp-1 and Lisp-2?.  The big difference is when the system sees a function call, how it figures out what function to call.  In a Lisp-1, variables have values, and that's all.  So when the system sees something like:
(f ...)

f is a variable, and the only possible thing to call is the value of f.  In a Lisp-2, the systems tries to call the function value of f, which doesn't have to have anything do with the value of the variable f.  That can be a bit confusing at first, but it's actually pretty handy in many cases, because it makes it harder to accidentally obscure functions with common names.  E.g., in a Lisp-1, you'll see lots of people use lst as an argument name instead of list, because if they named the argument list, then they couldn't use the (standard) function list within the function.
",,"The issue you are encountering is due to the scope of the variable `f` defined within the `let` form. In Emacs Lisp, like in Common Lisp, a lambda expression defined with `lambda` or `let` is local to that form and does not create a globally accessible function unless explicitly assigned to a global symbol. When you use `(let ((f (lambda (x) (* x x)))) (f 7))`, the variable `f` is only in scope within the `let` form, so it cannot be directly called outside of that scope without using `funcall`.

To make `f` accessible globally or to avoid this scoping issue, you can define a global symbol for your function. Here are two ways to achieve this:

1. **Using `defun`:**
   ```elisp
   (defun square (x) (* x x))
   (square 7) ; This will return 49
   ```

2. **Assigning the lambda directly to a symbol:**
   ```elisp
   (let ((f (lambda (x) (* x x))))
     (funcall f 7)) ; This will return 49
   ```

Alternatively, if you want to use `cl-flet` and avoid `funcall`, you can do so as follows:

```elisp
(require 'cl)
(cl-letf (((symbol-function 'f) (lambda (x) (* x x))))
  (f 7)) ; This will return 49
```

In this case, `cl-letf` is used to temporarily set the function definition for the symbol `f`, and then you can call it directly.",0.606,[[0.5131495]],0.19544034986615597,0.2781991322244289,0.3723404255319149,0.08185053380782918,0.16312056737588654
"I need to write a recursive function in Scheme which takes a list of atoms and reverses it in linear time. I am only allowed to use  define, lambda, cons, car, cdr, cond, let, and null? . Here is what I have so far:
(define reverse
  (lambda (lat)
    (cond
      ((null? lat) lat)
      (else (cons (reverse (cdr lat)) (cons (car lat) '()))))))

So when I call the function:
(reverse '(a b c d))

I get the following output:
'(() (((() 4) 3) 2) 1)

Any help would be very much appreciated.
","The problem is that if (reverse (cdr lat)) returns a list eg (3 2) then (cons '(3 2) (1)) turns into ((3 2) 1).
A classical way to do this would be to make a local procedure that takes an accumulator as well as the argument of the global procedure. As you are iterating the list from the beginning to the end you accumulate a list from the end to the beginning making it the exact reverse order from the argument. When the iterated list is null your answer is in the accumulator. As you notice you iterate once each element and when you hit the empty list you return the accumulator it's a perfect O(n) 
As a hint:
(define (myreverse lst)
  (define (myreverse-aux lst acc)
    (if (null? <??>)
        <??>
        (myreverse-aux <??> (cons <??> <??>))))

Here is a version using foldl
(define (myreverse lst)
  (foldl cons '() lst))

",,"The issue with your function is that it's not correctly reversing the list. The problem lies in how you're using `cons` within the recursive call. Instead of reversing the rest of the list and then prepending the current car, you should first build the reversed sublist without the current car and then append the current car at the end. Here’s a corrected version of your function:

```scheme
(define reverse
  (lambda (lat)
    (cond
      ((null? lat) lat)
      (else (append (reverse (cdr lat)) (list (car lat)))))))
```

This function works by recursively building the reversed list and then using `append` to concatenate the current car at the end of the reversed sublist. Now, if you call `(reverse '(a b c d))`, it will correctly return `'(d c b a)`.

You can query or define them similarly as you do with other constants in C.\n\nIf your goal is to use these constants more conveniently, you might consider defining them directly in your Lisp code or binding them from a foreign header file using tools like `cffi` (Common Foreign Function Interface) for Common Lisp, if not already available through the libraries you are using. For example:\n\n```lisp\n(define-constant +lc-c-type+ (foreign-enum-value '(:int) ",0.4975,[[0.22677377]],0.03002983196448449,0.19452590420332355,0.20754716981132076,0.018987341772151896,0.10691823899371068
"From what I understand, Common Lisp has no global lexical scope, so if you want to create a global variable you have to use defvar instead of setq. I'm trying to create a macro that just does this automatically, i.e. I'd like to write
(= x 1)

and have it ""just work"" no matter where I am. I imagine the macro would look something like
(defmacro = (name value)
  `(,(if (is-global) 'defvar 'setf) ,name ,value))

How can I write is-global?
","Introducing Bindings

From what I understand, Common Lisp has no global lexical scope,

This part is correct, but there are some ""typical"" workarounds.  There's no canonical implementation, but searching for deflexical can lead you to some implementations.

so if you want to create a global variable you have to use defvar
  instead of setq. (emphasis added)

This is incorrect.  For the most part, you don't really create variables.  You introduce bindings into an environment.  The most common way of doing this is with let or as arguments to a function.  E.g.:
(defun foo (bar)
   ;; in here, there's a variable `bar`
   )

(let ((a ...))
  ;; a is bound in here

These are lexical bindings, unless the symbol that identifies the variable in the source is declared as special, which in Common Lisp means that it's a dynamically scoped variable.  You can do special declarations like:
(defun foo (bar)
   (declare (special bar))
   ;; in here, there's a variable `bar`
   )

(let ((a ...))
  (declare (special a))
  ;; a is bound in here

Now, you can also introduce global variables with defparameter and defvar.  These globally declare a variable as special.  
Updating Bindings
In both cases, you can use setq or setf to update the value of a variable.  That is, you can use setq or setf to update the value of lexical variables as well as special variables.  So you can do:
(defparameter *cat* (make-initial-cat))

(let ((cat (some-local-cat)))
  (setf *cat* (make-instance 'cat)) ; update global/dynamic
  (setf cat (make-instance 'cat))   ; update local/lexical

setf works in both cases, so it sounds like the assignment operator you're looking for is just setf.
The issue that it sounds like you're trying to work around is that you're not supposed to use setf/setq with undeclared variables.  Indeed, that's undefined behavior.  So it sounds like you're trying to make your assignment operator automatically introduce a variable if there's not one in the surrounding environment.  You can't do this, for at least two reasons:

How would you know whether to introduce a lexical or dynamic variable?  You can't determine it from the surrounding environment, because if it was already in the surrounding environment, you wouldn't need to introduce it.
There's no way to check whether it's already declared as a local or dynamic variable.  There are some workaround alternatives that will work in some cases, but environment access isn't part of standard Common Lisp. (See a related question: Macro to detect global scope.  Some implementations do implement the CLtL2 environnments API.)

",,"In Common Lisp, you cannot directly determine if a variable will be treated as global or lexical within a macro. The `setq` form does not differentiate between global and lexical variables; it only sets the value of the variable in its current lexical scope. To achieve your goal, you would need to handle this logic manually by checking the symbol's package or using other means to determine if it is intended to be global. However, Common Lisp macros do not have direct access to such information without additional context or metadata. Here is a simplified approach that might work for your case, but remember it has limitations and may not cover all scenarios:\n\n```lisp\n(defmacro = (name value)\n  (let ((symbol-name (symbol-name name)))\n    `(if (find-symbol ,\",0.5798,[[0.42092882]],0.024799962154316676,0.12451958458599525,0.25886524822695034,0.0498220640569395,0.12411347517730496

I've been able to get that far down, however, if I then do car on the result it works, but if I add another a into the short-hand form, I get an error:
(car (cdaddr x7)) ; OK
(cadaddr x7)      ; cadaddr: unbound identifier in: cadaddr

Does the short-hand form only go up to five chars/steps, or is there something else I'm missing here?
","According to the R6RS report:

Arbitrary compositions, up to four deep, are provided. There are twenty-eight of these procedures in all.

This is identical to R5RS and the new R7RS report. There is nothing stopping an implementation from adding more of course, but using these removes portability of your program as other implementations might only provide the required 4 deep.
You can provide your own of course:
(define (cadadadr p)
  (cadar (cdadr p)))

Since Scheme does not have any reserved words this should work even if the language or the implementation decides to include these at a later time. It will simply never use the new one and use your definition.
",,"The shorthand forms for car and cdr (such as caddr, cadddr) are predefined in Common Lisp up to a certain number of steps.

As far as I know &rest parameters are treated as a list in the function body but since 
(rest indexes) also returns a list I'm stuck with nested Lists as parameters.
For example (test '(""a"" ""b"" ""c"" (""d"" ""e"")) 3 1 6 7) 
would cause indexes to be ((1 6 7))  at the second call.
Is there any way to pass my list without having this problem?
","rest is a accessor function that is paired together with first to give you the first element and the rest of the list. rest is the same as cdr.
&rest is a lambda list keyword that slurps the remaining arguments in the variable name that follows it.
You are really looking for apply. Imagine I make a function that can take 0 or more numeric parameters and add them together:
(defun add (&rest numbers)
  (apply #'+ numbers))

Apply can take more than two arguments. The first is the function to call and all but the last are extra arguments that are put in front of the last arguments element. You are guaranteed the implementation supports 50 arguments or upto the number of arguments a function can take in that particular implementation supports above 50.
(apply #'+ 1 2 '(3 4 5)) ; ==> 15

Now recursing by &rest and apply makes inefficient code so you should use higher order functions, loop macro, or make a helper:
;; higher order function
(defun fetch-indexes (a &rest indexes)
  (mapcar (lambda (i) (nth i a)) indexes))

;; loop macro
(defun fetch-indexes (a &rest indexes)
  (loop :for i :in indexes
        :collect (nth i a)))

;; helper function
(defun fetch-indexes (a &rest indexes)
  (labels ((helper (indexes)
             (if (endp indexes)
                 '()
                 (cons (nth (first indexes) a)
                       (helper (rest indexes))))))
    (helper indexes)))

;; test (works the same with all)
(fetch-indexes '(a b c d) 2 3 0 1)
; ==> (c d a b)

Using apply in recursion should be avoided, but I'll show how it's done.
(defun fetch-indexes (a &rest indexes)
  (if (endp indexes)
      '()
      (cons (nth (first indexes) a)

In your example you have nested lists. In order for that to work you would need to flatten it as well. I haven't done that so these supports one proper list of elements. 
",,"The issue you are encountering is due to how Common Lisp handles &rest parameters and nested lists. The function `test` expects a flat list of indexes but receives a nested list.

Define a local reverse variable, bound to NIL by default (you could set it to '(), this is sometimes preferred).
Use DOLIST to iterate over a list and perform side-effects; the third argument is the return value; here you can put the reverse variable where we accumulate the reversed list.
For each element elt, push it in front of reverse; if you want to avoid push for learning purposes, use (setf reverse (cons elt reverse)).

Common Lisp is multi-paradigm and favors pragmatic solutions: sometimes a loop is more natural or more efficient, and there is no reason to force yourself to adopt a functional style.
Functional implementation
However, lists provide a natural inductive structure: recursive approaches may be more appropriate in some cases.
If you wanted to use a functional style to compute reverse, be aware that tail-call optimization, though commonly available, is not required by the language specification (it depends on your implementation capabilities and compiler options).
With default settings, SBCL eliminates calls in tail positions and would eliminate the risk of stack overflows with large inputs. But there are other possible ways to obtain bad algorithmic complexities (and wasteful code) if you are not careful.
The following is what I'd use to define the combination of union and reverse; in particular, I prefer to define a local function with labels to avoid calling new-union with a dummy nil parameter. Also, I iterate the list resulting from the union only once.
(defun new-union (l1 l2)

Remark
It is quite surprising to reverse the result of union, when the union is supposed to operate on unordered sets: the order of elements in the result do not have to reflect the ordering of list-1 or list-2 in any way. Sets are unordered collections having no duplicates; if your input lists already represent sets, as hinted by the name of the function (new-union), then it makes no sense to remove duplicates or expect the order to be meaningful. 
If, instead, the input lists represents sequences of values, then the order matters; feel free to use append or concatenate in combination with remove-duplicates, but note that the latter will remove elements in front of the list by default:
(remove-duplicates (concatenate 'list '(4 5 6) '(2 3 4)))
=> (5 6 2 3 4)

You may want to use :from-end t instead.
",,"The issue with your code lies in how you are using `car` and `cdr`. The variable `l` is being modified within the loop, which causes incorrect behavior. Instead of modifying `l`, you should be updating `res` directly.

The key change is using `(setf res (cons x res))` instead of `(setq res (cons (car l) res))` which correctly builds the reversed list.\n\nYou can test this function with your example:\n```lisp\n(new-union '(a b c) '(d e f))\n```\nThis should give you the expected output: `'(f e d c b a)`.",0.5761,[[0.47057341]],0.014747310885870309,0.10031828302920862,0.24791418355184744,0.0931899641577061,0.12395709177592372

      (let ((prev-combinations (boolean-combinations (- n 1))))

```

This function works as follows:
1. Base case: If `n` is 0, return a list containing an empty list.
2. Recursive step: For each combination of length `n-1`, generate two new combinations by adding both `#f` and `#t` at the beginning of each previous combination.

This approach ensures that you get all possible combinations of `x` booleans.",0.5857,[[0.18580844]],0.07536495373473949,0.3283176215866166,0.19900497512437812,0.020100502512562818,0.08955223880597016

"I read in the book 'On Lisp' that one should avoid excessive use of cons in the body of expanded macros.  Why is cons considered to be an inefficient operation?  Does Lisp not do structure sharing with the cons cells?
","You need to understand the jargon first.
CONS is a primitive operation to create a fresh cons cell.
Consing means allocation of memory on the heap in general, not only cons cells: Consing of numbers, Consing of arrays, Consing of CLOS objects, ...
The definition from the 'memory management glossary' says:

cons(1) In Lisp, cons is a primitive operation creating a list element (from English ""CONStruct""). By extension, a cons is the element created.
cons(2) (for full details, see allocate) Allocation is the process
of assigning resources. When
requested to by the program, an
application memory manager or
allocator allocates a block of
memory(2) for the program to store
its data in. Allocation is also
known as consing, from cons(1).

So, Graham uses the second meaning.
If Graham says 'Avoid consing especially. A utility which conses unnecessarily can ruin the performance of an otherwise efficient program.' - that means: avoid unnecessary memory allocation on the heap. But this can be true for any code - macro, function, whatever.
That was particular true when computers had less memory and Garbage Collection was more costly (especially when it needed to scan swapped out memory in virtual memory systems, where the physical memory is smaller than the virtual memory).
Today consing is less an issue, but can still be relevant.
Take for example a the function READ-LINE, it reads a line from a stream and 'conses' a new string. Note that the string is not built out of conses, but it is a vector. We mean here 'allocates a string on the heap'. If you have a large file with lots of lines, it can be faster to have a routine that gets a buffer and which fills the buffer with the line characters (there are vectors in Common Lisp with a fill pointer for this). That way the line buffer is just one object and can potentially be reused for calls to this line reading function.
See this example in the Allegro CL documentation: Some techniques for reducing consing when processing very large text files.
",,"The `cons` function in Lisp constructs a new pair, which consumes both space and time. While it does provide structure sharing (i.e., when creating pairs that share common parts), this sharing is only utilized if the same exact cons cells are reused directly. However, with `cons`, each call to create a list or pair results in new cons cells being allocated unless the programmer explicitly takes steps to reuse existing ones.

Avoiding excessive use of `cons` within macro expansions can improve performance because it reduces the number of cons cells created and helps manage memory more efficiently. By minimizing the creation of new structure, you can reduce overhead and potentially enhance the performance of your Lisp programs.

Structure sharing in cons cells is a powerful feature when used properly, but it doesn't automatically apply to every usage of `cons`. For example, if you create a large list or deeply nested data structures within macro expansions using `cons`, this can lead to increased memory consumption. Therefore, being mindful of how and where `cons` is used is important for writing efficient Lisp code.",0.5632,[[0.50233635]],0.09921157238338614,0.21451234653055593,0.38257575757575757,0.06844106463878327,0.14393939393939395

(defun my-list (&rest x) …

The &rest parameter means that all remaining arguments are put into a list that is bound to this parameter.  X then holds the list that you want.  You're done.
(defun my-list (&rest x)
  x)

",,"The issue you encountered is due to how `list` works in Lisp. When you call `(list x)`, it creates a list containing `x` as its single element. If `x` itself is already a list, then `list x` will return that same list wrapped inside another list because `x` is treated as a single argument. However, by adding `(car (list x))`, you are taking the car of that single-element list, effectively extracting just the content of `x`. 

Here's why your initial code produced a list inside a list:

```lisp
(defun mylist (&rest x)
  (list x))
```

When you pass multiple elements to `mylist`, such as `(mylist 1 2 3)`, `x` becomes a list of those arguments: `(1 2 3)`. So, `(list x)` returns `((1 2 3))`, which is a list containing the original list. By using `(car (list x))`, you extract just `(1 2 3)` from `((1 2 3))`.

Is there a more idiomatic way to do this in clojure?
","
Prefer vectors to lists.  You don't have to quote a vector most of the time, and it has better performance for a lot of things, like random access.  Lists are used much more rarely in Clojure than in other Lisps.
Prefer keywords to quoted symbols.  Keywords stand out as ""constant strings"" or enumerated values.  Keywords in Clojure can belong to a namespace, so they have all the advantages of symbols.  And again, there's no need to quote keywords, which is nice.  Quoted symbols are used pretty rarely in Clojure, unless you're writing macros.
#'first is the var called ""first""; first is the value of the var called ""first"", i.e. the fn.  In this case (#'first foo) and (first foo) give the same answer, but #'first does an extra dereference every time you call it.  So don't do this unless you want that dereference to happen over and over.  There's usually no need to use #'.
The built-in map is lazy, whereas yours isn't. The built-in map takes advantage of chunked seqs for better performance, whereas yours doesn't.  Idiomatic code doesn't have to be lazy or use chunked seqs, but keep in mind that the builtins have some of this magic going on.  So it's good to take advantage.
Rather than (= '() x), the idiomatic test for an empty seq is (seq x), which returns nil if x is empty.  Note that in Clojure, (= '() nil) is false.
If you do ever need to use the empty list (which you should rarely need to do), you don't have to quote it.  Just use ().
Built-in map takes the function argument first because it accepts multiple collection arguments.  When a function takes multiple arguments, those arguments have to go last in the argument list.  I think it reads better the other way too: ""(map f coll): map this function across this collection"".
There's no need to use cond if you only have two options.  You can use if instead.  And if one of the branches in your if returns nil, you can use when.  It's nice to use when and if when appropriate, because they signal your intentions to the reader immediately, whereas cond could do anything and forces the reader to read more.

Rafał Dowgird's version is idiomatic, except I'd flip the order of arguments around.  And I'd call it like this:

"I'm still having problems to really grasp case. I have understood that you provide symbols which are internally compared using eq, but I'm not sure if I have gotten one thing correctly:
I have seen that I can write, e.g.:
(case n
  (23 'foo)
  (42 'bar)
  (otherwise 'something-else))

I can also write:
(case n
  ((23 42) 'foo-or-bar)
  (otherwise 'something-else))

So am I right that if I specify a list that case then checks whether the variable n matches one of the list's elements, but if I specify a single value, then case directly matches this value?
In other words: Is it okay to use the non-list version if I only have a single value?
","Keys are conceptually lists of keys
Conceptually each clause uses a list of keys. The test-key will be compared against each key in the keylist.
The key list (foo bar baz) is exactly (foo bar baz). 
The key foo is thought to denote (foo). It helps to write code shorter.
(case x
  (foo       41)
  ((bar baz) 42)))

The exception of T and OTHERWISE
Note that otherwise and (otherwise), t and (t) are exceptions. You need to write (otherwise) if you want to match the symbol:
(case 'otherwise
  ((otherwise) 'the-symbol-otherwise)
  (otherwise   'the-otherwise-clause))

EQ vs. EQL
Also note that most comparisons in Common Lisp are done by default with EQL, not EQ. EQ is pointer equality, EQL also works for numbers and characters.
",,"Yes, you are correct. The `case` form in Common Lisp behaves differently based on whether the test expression (in your case, `n`) is compared against a single value or a list of values.

- If you provide a single value inside parentheses, like `(23 'foo)`, `case` directly checks if `n` is equal to that value using `eq`.

- If you provide a list containing multiple values, such as `((23 42) 'foo-or-bar)`, `case` checks if `n` matches any of the elements in the list. In this case, it would match either `23` or `42`.

        13

Regarding the constants, 13 is used only once in the innermost expression, so it's a good fit to be used as an initial value. 9 is used to multiply the accumulated value.

"I like Clojure. One thing that bothers me about the language is that I don't know how lazy sequences are implemented, or how they work.
I know that lazy sequences only evaluate the items in the sequence that are asked for. How does it do this?

What makes lazy sequences so efficient that they don't consume much
stack?
How come you can wrap recursive calls in a lazy sequence and no
longer get a stack over flow for large computations?
What resources do lazy sequences consume to do what it does?
In what scenarios are lazy sequences inefficient?
In what scenarios are lazy sequences most efficient?

","Let's do this.
• I know that lazy sequences only evaluate the items in the sequence that are asked for, how does it do this?
Lazy sequences (henceforth LS, because I am a LP, or Lazy Person) are composed of parts. The head, or the part(s, as really 32 elements are evaluated at a time, as of Clojure 1.1, and I think 1.2) of the sequence that have been evaluated, is followed by something called a thunk, which is basically a chunk of information (think of it as the rest of the your function that creates the sequence, unevaluated) waiting to be called. When it is called, the thunk evaluates however much is asked of it, and a new thunk is created, with context as necessary (how much has been called already, so it can resume from where it was before).
So you (take 10 (whole-numbers)) – assume whole-numbers is a lazy sequence of whole numbers. That means you're forcing evaluation of thunks 10 times (though internally this may be a little difference depending on optimizations.
• What makes lazy sequences so efficient that they don't consume much stack?
This becomes clearer once you read the previous answer (I hope): unless you call for something in particular, nothing is evaluated. When you call for something, each element of the sequence can be evaluated individually, then discarded.
If the sequence is not lazy, oftentimes it is holding onto its head, which consumes heap space. If it is lazy, it is computed, then discarded, as it is not required for subsequent computations.
• How come you can wrap recursive calls in a lazy sequence and no longer get a stack over flow for large computations?
See the previous answer and consider: the lazy-seq macro (from the documentation) will
will invoke the body only the first time seq
is called, and will cache the result and return it on all subsequent
seq calls.

Check out the filter function for a cool LS that uses recursion:
(defn filter
  ""Returns a lazy sequence of the items in coll for which
  (pred item) returns true. pred must be free of side-effects.""
  [pred coll]
  (let [step (fn [p c]
                 (when-let [s (seq c)]
                   (if (p (first s))
                     (cons (first s) (filter p (rest s)))
                     (recur p (rest s)))))]
    (lazy-seq (step pred coll))))

• What resources do lazy sequences consume to do what it does?
I'm not quite sure what you're asking here. LSs require memory and CPU cycles. They just don't keep banging the stack, and filling it up with results of the computations required to get the sequence elements.
•  In what scenarios are lazy sequences inefficient?
When you're using small seqs that are fast to compute and won't be used much, making it an LS is inefficient because it requires another couple chars to create.
In all seriousness, unless you're trying to make something extremely performant, LSs are the way to go.
•  In what scenarios are lazy sequences most efficient?
When you're dealing with seqs that are huge and you're only using bits and pieces of them, that is when you get the most benefit from using them.
Really, it's pretty much always better to use LSs over non-LSs, in terms of convenience, ease of understanding (once you get the hang of them) and reasoning about your code, and speed.
",,"Lazy sequences in Clojure (and Lisp in general) are a powerful feature that allows for on-demand computation of elements. Here's how they work and why they can be so efficient:

1. **How Lazy Sequences Work**: A lazy sequence only evaluates the items that are actually needed at any given time. This is achieved through the use of `thunk` (a closure that holds unevaluated expressions) to defer computation until an item in the sequence is accessed. When you traverse a lazy sequence, each element is computed on-demand and then cached for future reference.

2. **Efficiency in Stack Usage**: Lazy sequences are efficient with respect to stack usage because they avoid unnecessary evaluations. In a typical recursive function, every call consumes stack space, which can lead to stack overflow errors for large computations. By deferring evaluation until absolutely necessary, lazy sequences ensure that only the part of the computation needed at any given time is on the stack. This makes them suitable for deep recursion or infinite data structures.

3. **Resources Consumption**: Lazy sequences consume minimal resources compared to eager sequences because they do not compute elements unless explicitly required. The resources they use include memory for caching computed values and the overhead of maintaining thunks. However, this overhead is generally small compared to the benefits gained from avoiding premature computation and potential stack overflow issues.

4. **Scenarios Where Lazy Sequences Are Inefficient**:
   - **Highly Computationally Intensive Computations**: If each item in the sequence requires a lot of CPU time to compute, lazy sequences may not provide much benefit since the overhead of creating thunks might be significant.
   - **Non-Traversable Data Structures**: For data structures that cannot be traversed multiple times (e.g., once-computed values), lazy sequences add unnecessary complexity and overhead.

5. **Scenarios Where Lazy Sequences Are Most Efficient**:
   - **Infinite Data Structures**: Lazy sequences allow for the definition of infinite data structures, which can be navigated and consumed as needed.
   - **Deep Recursion**: In scenarios where deep recursion is necessary but there's a risk of stack overflow in eager languages, lazy sequences provide a safe alternative.
   - **Lazy Evaluation of Expensive Computations**: When computations are expensive but only parts of the results are required, lazy evaluation can save resources by computing only what’s needed.

In summary, lazy sequences in Clojure are efficient because they defer computation until necessary and thus avoid unnecessary stack usage. They excel in scenarios where infinite data structures or deep recursion is involved, but may be less suitable for highly computationally intensive tasks.",0.5976,[[0.56397817]],0.17282992077510298,0.27848482750938225,0.4565656565656565,0.09109311740890688,0.1717171717171717

","From the documentation of conj:

clojure.core/conj
  ([coll x] [coll x & xs])
    conj[oin]. Returns a new collection with the xs
      'added'. (conj nil item) returns (item).  The 'addition' may
      happen at different 'places' depending on the concrete type.

The termination condition of your function yields nil, because the test is a when. So the deepest conj call will be:
(conj nil 1)
(1) <-- a list

The next one:
(conj (conj nil 1) 2)
(2 1)

So your result will be in decreasing order because conj appends at the front for lists. If you want it in increasing order, start with an empty vector like this:
((fn foo [x] (if (> x 0) (conj (foo (dec x)) x) [])) 5)
[1 2 3 4 5]

",,"The code you provided is a recursive function in Lisp that uses `conj` to accumulate values into a list. The reason why the result is [5 4 3 2 1] instead of [1 2 3 4 5] is due to how recursion and accumulation work in this case.

When the function `(foo (dec x))` is called recursively, it starts from `x = 5` and decrements down to `x = 0`. At each step, the current value of `x` is added to the list that is being built up. However, because you're using `conj`, which builds a new list by adding an element to the beginning of the existing list, the elements are inserted in reverse order.

Here's a breakdown:

1. `(foo 5)` calls `(foo 4)`.
2. `(foo 4)` calls `(foo 3)`.
3. This continues until `(foo 0)` returns `nil` (or an empty list).
4. When the recursion unwinds, each call adds its argument to the front of the list that was returned by the next recursive call.

So, starting from the bottom:
- `(foo 0)` returns `nil`.
- `(foo 1)` then builds `[1]`.
- `(foo 2)` builds `[2 1]`.
- And so on...

This is why you get [5 4 3 2 1] instead of [1 2 3 4 5]. If you want the list to be built in ascending order, you would need to modify the function to add elements at the end of the list or use a different approach.",0.5858,[[0.47681701]],0.1562971107865657,0.386907056750651,0.40331491712707185,0.11666666666666667,0.1712707182320442
"Sometimes we need to modify a place but here is no built-in function that meets our needs.
For instance, here are incf and decf for addition and subtraction:
CL-USER> (defvar *x* 5)
*X*
CL-USER> (incf *x* 3)
8
CL-USER> *x*
8
CL-USER> (decf *x* 10)
-2
CL-USER> *x*
-2

But how about multiplication and division? What if we wish to modify a place with arbitrary function, like this:
(xf (lambda (x) ...) *x*)

xf utility would be very useful, especially when we have to deal with deeply nested structures:
(my-accessor (aref (cdr *my-data*) n))

","Defining new macros with define-modify-macro
One simple way to define new handy macros for our needs is define-modify-macro. This is a handy macro which can create other macros for us.

Syntax:
define-modify-macro name lambda-list function [documentation]
⇒ name

We should supply name of new macro, list of parameters (not including place there) and symbol of function that will be used for processing.
Example of use:
(define-modify-macro togglef () not
  ""togglef modifies place, changing nil value to t and non-nil value to nil"")

(define-modify-macro mulf (&rest args) *
  ""mulf modifies place, assigning product to it"")

(define-modify-macro divf (&rest args) /
  ""divf modifies place, assigning result of division to it"")

However, define-modify-macro cannot be used for arbitrary processing. Here we have to take a look at other possibilities.
Function get-setf-expansion
Function get-setf-expansion does not create any macros, but provides information which we can use to write our own.

Syntax:
get-setf-expansion place &optional environment
⇒ vars, vals, store-vars, writer-form, reader-form

As you can see, it returns a bunch of values, so it may be confusing at first sight. Let's try it on example:
CL-USER> (defvar *array* #(1 2 3 4 5))
*ARRAY*
CL-USER> (get-setf-expansion '(aref *array* 1))
; get-setf-expansion is a function, so we have to quote its argument
(#:G6029 #:G6030)        ; list of variables needed to modify place
(*ARRAY* 1)              ; values for these variables
(#:G6031)                ; variable to store result of calculation
(SYSTEM::STORE #:G6029   ; writer-form: we should run it to modify place
               #:G6030   ; ^
               #:G6031)  ; ^  
(AREF #:G6029 #:G6030)   ; reader-form: hm.. looks like our expression

Writing xf macro
It seems like now we've got all information to write our xf macro:
(defmacro xf (fn place &rest args &environment env)
  (multiple-value-bind (vars forms var set access)
      (get-setf-expansion place env)
    (let ((g (gensym)))
      `(let* ((,g ,fn)   ; assign supplied function to generated symbol
              ,@(mapcar #'list vars forms) ; generate pairs (variable value)
              (,(car var) (funcall ,g ,access ,@args))) ; call supplied function
              ; and save the result, we use reader-form here to get intial value
         ,set)))) ; just put writer-from here as provided

Note, that xf macro takes evironment variable and pass it to get-setf-expansion. This variable is needed to ensure that any lexical bindings or definitions established in the compilation environment are taken into account.
Let's try it:
CL-USER> (defvar *var* '((""foo"" . ""bar"") (""baz"" . ""qux"")))
*VAR*
CL-USER> (xf #'reverse (cdr (second *var*)))
""xuq""
CL-USER> *var*
((""foo"" . ""bar"") (""baz"" . ""xuq""))

Expansion:
(LET* ((#:G6033 #'REVERSE)
       (#:TEMP-6032 (SECOND *VAR*))
       (#:NEW-6031 (FUNCALL #:G6033
                            (CDR #:TEMP-6032))))
  (SYSTEM::%RPLACD #:TEMP-6032 #:NEW-6031))

I hope this information is useful.
This answer is based on Paul Graham's On Lisp, section 12.4 More Complex Utilities.
",,"In Lisp, you can achieve similar functionality for multiplication and division by defining your own functions. For example, you can define `xfm` (for multiplication) and `xdf` (for division) to modify a place with an arbitrary function. Here's how you might implement such functions:

(defun xfm (function place)
  (setf place (funcall function place)))

(defun xdf (function place &optional (divisor 1))

(defvar *x* 5)
(xfm #'+ *x* 3) ;; *x* will be set to 8
(xdf #'* *x* 2) ;; *x* will be set to 4

"How to import modules in Scheme (guile especially)?
How to create a module and import it in another script in scheme? How should I compile the script when I import a module, what are the command-line arguments that has to be passed? How to import the module if it is in another directory?
","Lets create a module test_module.scm with the following code in it and its location being /some/dir,
(define-module (test_module)
    #: export (square
               cube))

(define (square a)
    (* a a))
(define (cube a)
    (* a a a))

Here we have created a module using the syntax:
(define-module (name-of-the-module)
    #: export (function1-to-be-exported
               function2-to-be-exported))
;; rest of the code goes here for example: function1-to-be-exported

Now lets create a script that imports the module that we created named use_module.scm with this code in it, located in the current directory.
(use-modules (test_module))
(format #t ""~a\n"" (square 12))

Here we have used module using the syntax:
(use-modules (name-of-the-module))
;; now all the functions that were exported from the 
;; module will be available here for our use

Now lets come to the compiling part, we have to set GUILE_LOAD_PATH to the location /some/dir and then compile the script.
Now lets assume that both test_module.scm and use_module.scm are in the same directory, then do this:
$ GUILE_LOAD_PATH=. guile use_module.scm

but generally do this if the module is present in /some/dir:
$ GUILE_LOAD_PATH=/some/dir guile code.scm

p.s. The easier way to do this would be to write the script that uses add-to-load-path telling guile the location of the module. Now we can compile without worrying about the environment variables.
(add-to-load-path ""/some/dir"")
(use-modules (name-of-the-module))
;; rest of the code

",,"In Scheme (especially Guile), modules are a way to encapsulate code and data. Here's how you can create a module and import it into another script:

1. **Creating a Module:**
   - Create a file named `my-module.scm` with the following content:
     ```scheme
     ;; my-module.scm
     (define (add x y) (+ x y))
     ```

2. **Importing the Module in Another Script:**
   - To import and use the module, you can load it into your Scheme environment using `use` or `load`. For example:
     ```scheme
     ;; main.scm
     (use-modules (my-module))  ; Load the module if it's a standard scheme module name
     (add 1 2)                  ; Use the function from the module
     ```

3. **Compiling and Running:**
   - When you want to run your script, you can use Guile with appropriate arguments. For example:
     ```sh
     guile -s main.scm
     ```
   - If your module is in another directory, you need to specify the path to the module file using `load` or ensure that the directory containing the module is on Guile's load path.

4. **Adding a Module Directory to Load Path:**
   - You can add the directory containing `my-module.scm` to the load path:
     ```sh
     guile -s -L /path/to/module-dir main.scm
     ```
   - Or within your Scheme code, you can manually add it:
     ```scheme
     (use-modules (ice-9 files))

"I'm currently trying to do exercise 1.22, which needs a function called runtime that returns the number of milliseconds the system has been running. However, my environment (R5RS) does not seem to have this. It does not have time, current-milliseconds, current-inexact-milliseconds, etc, either. 
What function do I have access to, to profile my function? Which functions returns the number of milliseconds, microseconds, etc, that have passed? I would of course prefer the highest precision timer available.
","Probably, the best thing to do is switch the language in DrRacket to ""Use the language declared in the source"", and start your file with #lang racket.  Then functions like current-seconds and friends will be available.

Finally, you might want to look at Neil Van Dyke's SICP library for DrRacket.
",,"In R5RS (Revised Revised Fifth Report), the standard does not provide specific functions for measuring time. However, you can use available functions to approximate a high-precision timer.

This will give you the number of milliseconds since some arbitrary point in the past, which can be used to profile functions.\n\nIf `current-milliseconds` is not available, you might need to look into specific implementations that provide higher precision timers, such as `current-inexact-milliseconds`, `seconds`, or other platform-specific functions.",0.547,[[0.39221068]],0.10962860163556354,0.3619414101618585,0.3004291845493562,0.043290043290043295,0.1630901287553648
"As Rich Hickey says, the secret sauce of Lisp languages is the ability to directly manipulate the Abstract Syntax Tree through macros. Can this be achieved in any non-Lisp dialect languages?
","Being able to ""directly manipulate the abstract syntax tree"" by itself is nothing new, though it's something that very few languages have.  For example, many languages these days have some kind of an eval function -- but it should be obvious that that's not manipulating the abstract syntax tree, instead, it is a manipulation of the concrete syntax -- the direct source code.  Incidentally, the mentioned functionality in D falls under the same category, as is CPP: both deal with raw source text.
To give an example of a language that does have that feature (but not something that would be considered macros proper), see OCaml.  It has a syntactic extension system, CamlP4, which is essentially a compiler extension toolkit, and it revolves around the OCaml abstract syntax as its most important purpose.  But this is still not what makes the corresponding feature in Lisps so great.
The important feature of Lisps is that the extensions that you get using macros are part of the language in the same way that any other syntactic form is.  To put this differently, when you use something like if in a Lisp, there is no difference in functionality whether it's implemented as a macro or as a primitive form.  (Actually there is a minor difference: in some cases it's important to know the set of primitive forms that don't expand further.)  More specifically, a Lisp library can provide plain bindings and macros, which means that libraries can extend the language in a much more interesting way than the usual boring extensions you get in most languages, capable of adding only plain bindings (functions and values).
Now, viewed in this light, something like the D facility is very similar in nature.  But the fact that it deals with raw text rather than ASTs limit its utility.  If you look at the example on that page,
mixin(GenStruct!(""Foo"", ""bar""));

you can see how this doesn't look like part of the language -- to make it more like Lisp, you'd use it in a natural way:
GenStruct(Foo, bar);

with no need for a mixin keyword that marks where a macro is used, no need for that !, and the identifiers being specified as identifiers rather than strings.  Even better, the definition should be expressed more naturally, something like (inventing some bad syntax here):
template expression GenStruct(identifier Name, identifier M1) {
    return [[struct $Name$ { int $M1$; }; ]]
}

One important thing to note here is that since D is a statically typed language, ASTs have crept into this mental exercise in an explicit way -- as the identifier and expression types (I'm assuming here that template marks this as a macro definition, but it still needs a return type).
In Lisp, you're essentially getting something very close to this functionality, rather than the poor string solution.  But you get even more -- Lisp intentionally puns over the basic list type, and unifies the ASTs with the runtime language in a very simple way: the AST is made of symbols and lists and other basic literals (numbers, strings, booleans), and those are all part of the runtime language.  In fact, for those literals, Lisp takes another step forward, and uses the literals as their own syntax -- for example, the number 123 (a value that exists at runtime) is represented by a syntax which is also the number 123 (but now it's a value that exists at compile-time).  The bottom line of this is that macro-related code in Lisp tends to be far easier to deal with than what other languages call ""macro""s.  Imagine, for example, making the D example code create N int fields in a struct (where N is a new input to the macro) -- that would require using some function to translate a string into a number.
",,"While direct manipulation of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a hallmark feature of Lisp languages, achieving similar capabilities in non-Lisp dialects can be done with varying degrees of complexity and tooling. Some languages provide certain levels of metaprogramming or macro-like facilities that allow for AST manipulation to some extent. For example, languages like Scheme, which is a dialect of Lisp but sometimes considered distinct from other Lisps, offer similar capabilities through its hygienic macros. However, in general non-Lisp languages such as Python, Ruby, and Java, achieving the same level of control over the AST requires the use of specific libraries or tools that provide macro-like functionality (e.g., PySNOBOL for Python). Ultimately, while these other languages may not offer the same native support for AST manipulation found in Lisp, they can still achieve similar results with additional effort and specialized tooling.",0.5315,[[0.45087453]],0.00912940716628219,0.10027347310847766,0.22704081632653061,0.046035805626598474,0.10969387755102042

while you have an extra - in the sqrt call: (sqrt(- (* B B) - (* 4 A C)))) (* 2 A)) (the second -).
